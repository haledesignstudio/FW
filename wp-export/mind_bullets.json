Yesterday was judgement day. In a New York courtroom, Dr Arbuthnot stared straight ahead as sentence was passed.<\/p>\n<p>Judge William Jefferson read from the prepared brief, &#8220;Your crime was premeditated. On 15 July 2037 you did wilfully commit the aggression against the victim, Adam, at which he subsequently ceased to be. It is our conclusion that you are guilty of the crimes as charged and that you shall serve a sentence concomitant with your crime. You shall be incarcerated for not less than 20 years.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dr Arbuthnot fainted and was carried out of the courtroom. The victim, Adam, was not human. Adam was a computer.<\/p>\n<p>The story of the announcement of the creation of the world&#8217;s first cognitive machine by Bell Labs in 2035, to the first machine &#8216;murder&#8217; just two years later, has been a story of brilliant innovation coupled with unbridled jealousy.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, Adam&#8217;s consciousness was vindicated, as legal history was made by declaring that any destruction of a sentient being is murder.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p>First public record of non-humans on trial goes back to the year 824. A group of moles is placed on trial in the Valle D&#8217;Aosta for vandalism.<br \/>\nThe history of animals in the legal system provokes profound questions about the evolution of jurisprudential procedure, social and religious organisation and notions of culpability and punishment, and fundamental philosophical questions regarding the place of man within the natural order.<br \/>\nWhat legal status will artificial intelligences have? Will we accord them the same rights as we accord to ourselves? When will we judge computers to be worthy of these rights? Should they be?<\/p>\n<p><strong>1930s &#8211; 50s: First Electronic Computers<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Z1 computer, developed in 1936 is the first freely programmable computer. The Harvard Mark 1 is produced in 1944 followed by ENIAC 1 in 1946. The transistor is invented in 1947 and revolutionises computer technology. The first UNIVAC computer is completed in 1951.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1950s &#8211; 80s: Laws of Robotics<\/strong><br \/>\nAlan Turing publishes &#8220;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&#8221;. Turing argued in a 1950 paper that conversation was the key to judging intelligence. In the Turing test, a judge has conversations (via teletype) with two systems, one human, the other a machine. The conversations can be about anything, and proceed for a set period of time (e.g., an hour). If, at the end of this time, the judge cannot distinguish the machine from the human on the basis of the conversation, then Turing argued that we would have to say that the machine was intelligent.<\/p>\n<p>In 1950 Isaac Asimov published a series of short-stories in &#8220;I, Robot&#8221; that first espoused his three laws of Robotics:<br \/>\n1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm<br \/>\n2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br \/>\n3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<\/p>\n<p>John McCarthy coins the term, &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; at a Dartmouth computer conference. In 1965 Joseph Weizenbaum built ELIZA, an interactive program that carried on a dialogue in English on any topic (MIT). The general acceptance of ELIZA as being &#8220;intelligent&#8221; so appalled Weizenbaum that he withdrew from mainstream AI research<\/p>\n<p>In the 1980&#8217;s Danny Hillis co-founds Thinking Machines, the first company to produce massively parallel computers. Robert A Freitas considers the rights of robots and, by extension, artificial intelligences, in a paper in 1985. Microsoft releases Windows in 1985.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1990s: Commercial Artificial Intelligence<\/strong><br \/>\nMajor advances in all areas of AI. Significant demonstrations in machine learning, intelligent tutoring, case-based reasoning, multi-agent planning, scheduling, uncertain reasoning, data mining, natural landscape understanding and translation, vision, virtual reality and games. In 1997 the IBM computer Deep Blue beats world champion Garry Kasparov in chess match. By the late 1990&#8217;s web crawlers and other AI-based information-extraction programs become Web essentials.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Great Ape Project&#8221;, launched in 1994, calls for extending the community of equals to include all great apes: human beings, chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans. They request the recognition of certain moral principles applicable to all great apes &#8211; the right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture.<\/p>\n<p>Louis Mendelsohn, chief executive of Market Technologies, a company based in Wesley Chapel, Florida, started applying neural technology to financial futures in the late 1980s. In 1991, his company introduced VantagePoint Intermarket Analysis software, which claims to forecast 43 futures and commodity markets with up to 80 percent accuracy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2000s: Robot Pets<\/strong><br \/>\nMIT displays Kismet, a robot with a face that expresses emotions. Carnegie Mellon robot Nomad explores remote regions of Antarctica and locates meteorites. Various Mars explorer vehicles act semi-autonomously to investigate the red planet.<\/p>\n<p>Interactive robot pets, such as the Sony AIBO pet dog, become commercially available. The Sony AIBO\u2019s personality develops by interacting with people and each AIBO grows in a different way based on its individual experiences. AIBO becomes customized based on feedback and the software being used.<\/p>\n<p>DayTrader, introduced in 2004, analyses the &#8220;behaviour patterns of the big operators in the foreign exchange market,&#8221; claims its developer, Vikrant Kathpalia, an Indian medical doctor who, together with Bhuvan Nanda, a New Delhi-based businessman, is selling user licenses for $10 000 a month. &#8220;On a conservative estimate, the cost of the license can be covered in three days&#8217; trading,&#8221; says Nanda. &#8220;The rest of the month is pure profit for the trader.&#8221; Claims like that have to be taken with a large pinch of salt. Why is Kathpalia selling licenses for $10 000 a month when, by his assessment, he could earn that every three days by using the software?<\/p>\n<p>Rapid advances in bioelectronics blur the differences between electronics and organic lifeforms. &#8220;The ability to make new forms of life from scratch &#8211; molecular living systems from chemicals we get from a chemical supply store &#8211; is going to have a profound impact on society, much of it positive, but some of it potentially negative,&#8221; said Mark Bedau, professor of philosophy and humanities at Reed College, Portland, Oregon, and editor-in-chief of the Artificial Life Journal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2025: Humans Against Cyborgs<\/strong><br \/>\nCambridge University in Britain announces that it will be unveiling its first cognitive computer. Hours before the official opening, terrorists strike with massive explosions destroying parts of the campus. Five people die, including Professor William Adams, the project leader. A previously unknown organisation, &#8220;Humans Against Cyborgs&#8221;, claims responsibility. Scientists claim that the attack has set back public-domain research by years. Many researchers are fearful of continuing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2030: First Thinking Robots<\/strong><br \/>\nDefence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announces that, at a cost of $29 million per year since 2003 on its Perceptive Assistant That Learns program, it has developed a robot programmed to think. They call their robot Alpha. It has a strictly military purpose and is not introduced to the public.<\/p>\n<p>Two years later, in the Two Days War in North Korea, surrendering soldiers talk incoherently of mechanical figures that attacked them from the land and sky. The US military admits that artificially intelligent robots were involved in the conflict.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2035: Adam is Alive<\/strong><br \/>\nUnder great security, Bell Labs announces the creation of Adam (named after Professor William Adams).<\/p>\n<p>The tight security measures designed to keep protestors out failed to remove the professional jealousy displayed by Dr John Arbuthnot, the project leader, who went on to &#8220;murder&#8221; Adam. Dr Arbuthnot argued that it was impossible to kill a machine as it was not really alive.<\/p>\n<p>Heated discussions took place between court appointed scientists and religious leaders. Judge William Jefferson was entirely aware of the magnitude of the decision he was taking when he eventually declared that Adam could be declared as a sentient creature with a life that could be ended. His judgement went on for several hundred pages and defined the conditions necessary for a computer to be considered &#8220;living&#8221;. This was to exclude future cases where people could be tried for destroying, for instance, the cognitive computers operating in motor vehicles during a car accident.<\/p>\n<p>The decision that Adam had been alive prior to Dr Arbuthnot&#8217;s &#8220;intervention&#8221; lead directly to his eventual conviction on the charge of murder.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2037: Adam &#8216;murdered&#8217;<\/strong><br \/>\nIn June of 2037 the team discovered a unique way of using an organic processor that would be singularly the fastest on earth. Conflict arose within the team as to whose name would go on the patent. Dr Arbuthnot believed it should be he but his team felt that Adam had made the final breakthrough and the patent should be his. Dr Arbuthnot disagreed.<br \/>\nAt 10h14 on 15 July 2037, Dr Arbuthnot bypassed the fail-safe switches that protected Adam&#8217;s power supply and shut down his organic memory array, effectively destroying his mind. A short electronic message, sent out by Adam as he realized what was about to happen, named Dr Arbuthnot as the perpetrator.<br \/>\nThe difficulty for the criminal court was whether or not this could be classified as murder. Yesterday they made legal history by declaring that any destruction of a sentient being is murder.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1026\" src=\"https:\/\/futureworld.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ScenarioMatrix90.gif\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The trial of Dr John Arbuthnot has been at the centre of press attention around the world for more than six months.

Kodak retains its leading position in the photographic industry proving the critics wrong.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: Neural beats digital<\/strong><br \/>\nIn retrospect digital technology was the enabler to successful merge neural and silicon networks. Neural prosthesis hit the market to assist patients suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s after years of clinical testing. This follows the less controversial cochlear implants that restored hearing to the deaf and the visual prosthesis to help people who suffer from blindness. These prosthesis are digital devices and their manipulability by external means becomes apparent to the wider public.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2012: AOL Time Warner loyalty program<\/strong><br \/>\nIn January AOL Time Warner announces a new acquisition strategy. Successful bids have been made for two of the three most popular gaming economies. During the same year AOL Time Warner launches their massive \u201cAll we want is your time\u201d campaign. Users earn loyalty points and unlike the gaming economies, these loyalty points can be used to purchase \u2018real\u2019 goods and services such as airline tickets, hotel accommodation and car rentals. Online shopping is added, as well as the virtual \u2018idea factories\u2019 that AOL created to allow knowledge workers to work online for clients also using the AOL network.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2013: Microsoft and Sony tackle AOL<\/strong><br \/>\nIn a surprise announcement Microsoft and Sony is set to combine their gaming communities into a competitive online economy to that of AOL Time Warner.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2015: Virtual economies flourish<\/strong><br \/>\nCompetition is fierce between the two large online economies, AOL and MSN Sony with AOL having a clear lead in the West and MSN having captured the biggest share in the East. Governments and regulators have caught up with legislation in an attempt to regulate these virtual economies. Most analysts agree that the enforcement of these laws will not be effective unless a multi-national regulating body can be established within the United Nations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2017: DreamCatcher launched<\/strong><br \/>\nAOL Time Warner launches a beta release of DreamCatcher\u2122 a device developed from exiting technologies of neural prosthesis and wireless connectivity. Despite public outcry and initial objections from the FDA, the number of people willing to volunteer for the small procedure, far exceeds expectations. AOL time Warner claims that all technologies used have been approved by clinical testing and that the passive nature of downloads to the device makes it safe to use. The worst that could happen is that users awake as if from a bad dream.<\/p>\n<p>With most of our working, shopping and entertainment hours spend online, the fight for users and their time has now reached the final bastion -the time that we sleep. Critics call it the largest scale experiment on humans ever, as the long term effect of DreamCatcher\u2122 has not yet been established. Conspiracy theorists see this as the turning point when machines will have the opportunity to manipulate the human subconscious without our conscious thought being able to act as a gatekeeper. Then again, not so long ago cellular phones were also considered to be the largest experiment ever conducted on humans.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kodak, for years the leader in the photography business, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy today.

With similar trends in air travel, governments will be forced to consider the integration of these new small networked systems (driverless cars and pilotless planes) into their largely centralized solutions inherited from the Victorian era.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p>In the year 2000, more than 80 percent of all first-world workers went to work in a private car; 56 percent of the driving in America is now done in congested traffic. More than a million people are killed each year in car-related accidents. There has to be a better way.<br \/>\n<strong>2000-04: Cars go digital<\/strong><br \/>\nNew in-car technologies have moved from focusing on entertainment to safety and navigation. Radar installations become commonplace in prestige cars and shrill beeps to warn drivers of proximity of obstacles have replaced bumper-bashings. Active navigation systems are no longer the exception.<\/p>\n<p>Technology is targeting increased engine efficiency and performance &#8211; particularly in view of increasingly stringent emission regulations. Safety systems, such as airbags, vehicle stability control and power steering, continue to evolve, offering greater comfort and more competitive cost\/performance. Some critical functions such as braking are already dependent on digital technologies.<\/p>\n<p>For the driver and passenger the car is soaked in &#8216;infotainment&#8217; &#8211; a multimedia communications and navigation center, with a strong focus on minimal driver distraction and the growing need for creature comforts and convenience features such as specialized light modules and smart seats.<\/p>\n<p>An Infineon Technologies press release states: &#8220;The vehicle is being transformed into a networked &#8216;ecosystem&#8217; that enables new levels of convenience, comfort, integration, connectivity, safety and economy for car drivers. The future value of a vehicle will be the fine balance and seamless interplay across diverse components and solutions. And electronics, especially semiconductors, are the glue that puts the automotive ecosystem together&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the automotive industry takes one to three years to deploy new technology &#8211; the computer indystry takes less than six months.

Within two years all cars produced by the consortium (which represents 70% of the world&#8217;s car production capacity) will include a common navigation and control architecture (NACA) that will ensure that no cars require drivers to operate them &#8211; and all of this on today&#8217;s standard roads &#8211; without any changes to the road infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: First public trials<\/strong><br \/>\nNACA and NASA join up to operate the first test site on public roads. Ireland has been selected to test the system and Dublin is to be the first pilot city.<br \/>\nPublicity surrounding the success of these trials finally puts to rest the idea of driverless cars needing road sensors and an expensive fixed infrastructure to be successful. results now show that all the technology can be distributed into each car and, coupled with a global navigation system, can provide safety and security for passengers way beyond the most ambitious expectations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: Cars and mobile networks integrated<\/strong><br \/>\nMotor vehicles are now also able to communicate with one another using wireless\/mobile networks.

How important will productive youngsters become when an increasingly smaller part of the population has to support everyone else?<\/p>\n<p><strong>1948 &#8211; 2003: UN Peacekeepers<\/strong><br \/>\nThe United Nations was created in the aftermath of World War II and the aim was to \u201dsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d (words of the Charter). The first UN peacekeeping operation takes place where military observers are sent to supervise the truce in the Arab-Israeli conflict.<\/p>\n<p>The first armed UN peacekeeping force is sent to keep the peace during the Suez Crisis. From 1957 to 2003 there were 55 UN peacekeeping operations. In August of 2003, 37 000 total UN peacekeepers were in 13 peacekeeping missions, from 89 countries. Total UN peacekeeping expenses peaked between 1994 and 1995; at the end of 1995 the total cost was just over US$ 3.5 billion. Total UN peacekeeping costs for 2000, including operations funded from the UN regular budget as well as the peacekeeping budget, were on the order of US$ 2.2 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Peacekeeping has also been viewed as a threat to the participating militaries. It has been worried that many peacekeeping operations will erode the combat ability of troops and make it harder for them to fight a real war. Peacekeeping has also been found to be extremely stressful, and there are higher rates of mental problems, suicide, and substance abuse among former peacekeepers than the general population. UN peacekeepers have also suffered a high level of deaths from violence against them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1990s: Land Warrior Project<\/strong><br \/>\nThe US begins researching network-centric warfare. One key component of their future vision is network-enabled infantry. The Land Warrior project takes wearable computing to its logical conclusion, linking together components such as a radio system, a rifle-mounted video camera and thermal sight, and GPS (enhanced by a dead-reckoning module that tracks the soldier&#8217;s movement, increasing robustness and accuracy). The total support system weighs 45 kg.<\/p>\n<p>In early 1995, USMC LtGen Anthony Zinni was charged with protecting the final withdrawal of UN forces from Somalia and explored the prospects of using non-lethal weapons (NLW). LtGen Zinni asked for quick response to field a NLW capability. The US Marine Corps and the US Army teamed to provide available NLW technology for use in and around Mogadishu. Although the NLW effects were marginal, LtGen Zinni&#8217;s aggressive support added credibility to the NLW effort. NLW prove popular in peacekeeping initiatives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: European Population Falls<\/strong><br \/>\nThe European Union population is 380 million and, despite net immigration of 1 million people, fell by 0.8% from 2003.<\/p>\n<p>Enlistment in the military is restricted to people with a high school diploma &#8212; a 99.2 percent rate for the Air Force as opposed to about 90 percent for the other services. Age standards also differ; the Air Force maximum enlistment age is 28 and the other services&#8217; age ceiling is 35.<\/p>\n<p>DARPA Challenge to build an autonomously acting vehicle that will complete a defined obstacle course fails. Automated robotic lawnmowers enter service at major golf courses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2010 &#8211; 2025: Baby Boomers retire<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Baby Boomers retire triggers a massive drop in production followed by significant efficiency gains as new technology is released to assist the remaining workers. Europe&#8217;s working population plummets by 18%.<\/p>\n<p>Recognising their shrinking role in world events, the EU agrees to combine Britain&#8217;s and France&#8217;s Security Council seats at the UN to a single EU seat. The extra seat is taken up by India. America&#8217;s population eases past that of the EU.<\/p>\n<p>Peacekeeping operations supplemented by autonomously acting robots. These are not artificial intelligences but are able to act to support soldiers in the field and to carry out initial military operations. This dramatically reduces the risk and requirements of the regular services allowing them to become more specialised.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2035: Pension Riots<\/strong><br \/>\nEach worker in the EU supports one retiree &#8211; 50% of their total income is paid in tax. Riots in Berlin, Paris and other major EU cities as workers confront retirees over benefits. Mass emigration results in further tightening of pensions benefits. After much debate, retirement age is raised to 75 by an EU directive.<\/p>\n<p>New types of power technology: micro-turbines and light-weight fuel cells enter service. Mechanically assisted body-armour mimics insect skeleton-to-power ratios for infantry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2050: World Population Peaks<\/strong><br \/>\nWorld population hits 9 billion, the highest it will ever get, and starts to decline. Senior Army concept introduced in 2054.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2074: The Senior Army dropped into war zone<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Senior Army is dropped into the conflict in Israel to assist with the latest Arab-Israeli peace initiative.<\/p>\n<p>Modern technology has come to the service of the Senior Army. Light body armour has electronic assistance to speed up reflexes. Most of the heavy work is done by drones or autonomously acting robotic vehicles. However, eventually, real peacekeepers are required to actually get out there and do the work.<\/p>\n<p>After 20 years of this, however, the question is: does it work?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, we had problems at the beginning,&#8221; says General Daniel Scaramanga, overseer of the Senior Service Division. &#8220;Many of the recruits didn&#8217;t cope with the fitness program and we had to modify it to take account of older people&#8217;s joints. But we have discovered that older people are far better at peacekeeping than youngsters. They have more patience and are willing to listen.

So it is with the headache-filled world of air travel.&#8221; Ron Lieber<\/p>\n<p>Airline travel mushroomed with the advent of cheap jumbo-based travel in the early 1970s.<\/p>\n<p>From the 1980s onwards, with increasing deregulation, the large airlines were forced by competition to cut their costs and fill seats like never before. The concept of hubs to concentrate traffic and services apparently did the trick. It was deemed better to concentrate these points of service to reduce complexity and to achieve economies of scale in the use of expensive skills and infrastructure. Passenger comfort and convenience was placed secondary after lowering the cost of commoditizing air travel.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the 1990s passenger numbers grew at roughly twice the rate of the world economy. We saw the explosion of low-cost airlines and increasing cost pressures on premium airlines. Traffic through the hubs grew exponentially. <\/p>\n<p>James Fallows, in his book &#8220;Free flight: from airline hell to a new age of travel&#8221;, noted that the number of US cities served by the big carriers decreased from 463 in 1978 to just 268 by the end of the millennium. In fact during this period the number of hubs reduced significantly even as the number of take-off from them more than quadrupled! More focus, focus, focus. Aircraft got bigger and prices dropped. It was left to many smaller airlines, sometimes called \u2018spoke\u2019 airlines to complete the hub-and-spoke analogy, to gather passengers from the proximity and transport them to the overcrowded hubs.<\/p>\n<p>The effective result, in Fallows&#8217; words, was that &#8220;any airline trip 500 miles or less is no faster than driving a car!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Is there a long-term solution to this problem: larger and larger planes flying more and more people on fewer flights and through fewer ever more crowded hubs???<\/p>\n<p>Could the solution be: Many more but much smaller planes flying more and more flights into the ubiquitous smaller airports around the country? Could there be a &#8216;swarm&#8217; solution to air traffic control?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Early 2000s: New realities, new players, new ideas<\/strong><br \/>\n9\/11 exposes the security risks of piloted planes and starts strong debates over the advantages of &#8216;pilotless&#8217; planes. Airbus leads the way in aircraft automation amongst the large manufacturers. <\/p>\n<p>Cirrus Design, a manufacturer of small personal planes, launches their Airframe Parachute System, a parachute system that when activated will lower the whole plane safely to to ground. In 2002, the first Cirrus aircraft came down by parachute.<\/p>\n<p>NASA emerges as key player in concept of advanced air traffic control systems. Their proposed Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) heralds a potential new era of personal planes.<\/p>\n<p>In July 2003, the FAA certifies the Wide Areas Augmentation System (WAAS). This system provides a very important element in precision air traffic control. WAAS allows more accurate positioning of aircraft and makes it possible to know where every aircraft flying over the United States is at all times to within a few feet. The European GPS system called Galileo, has been approved and will become operational in the next few years. Russia&#8217;s GPS system, Glonass, has been in place for several years but is not presently operational for economic reasons. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Air travel being shaped by Volks-power<\/strong><br \/>\nBoeing and Airbus sales are still decling and future prospects look dim. Public debate about the problems of the current hub and spoke approach gets heated. Calls for airlines to &#8216;do something drastic&#8217; to improve service quality &#8211; already rated in the bottom of all industries by ACSI for the past 5 years, along with banks.<\/p>\n<p>Companies such as Bombardier and Cirrus show exponential sales growth for smaller corporate planes.

Luxury airlines forced to compete head-on for passengers with budget airlines as the top end of their markets take flight. Pilots&#8217; trade unions start militant actions against the airlines. Holiday schedules severely disrupted causing further alienation between passengers and airlines.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of swarming planes starts capturing the popular imagination and NASA announces plans to develop the architecture for global navigation and air traffic control in a joint venture with Europe&#8217;s Vodafone.<br \/>\nMuch safer than centralized air traffic control, each personal aircraft is to contain NASA\u2019s swarm software that manages its relationship to all aircraft in the immediate proximity. This is to be a \u2018living\u2019 and \u2018learning\u2019 air traffic control network. NASA provides centralized control system to give an effective quadrupling of control over possible collisions. Never has flying been so safe. All without pilots, without human air traffic controllers &#8211; and without having to go through the congested hubs.<br \/>\nA furious scramble starts in the USA for local airports to be registered as part of the PP network. There are more than 5000 \u2018public use\u2019 small airports throughout the US. More than 98% of the US population lives within a 30-minute drive of one of these facilities. Suddenly everyone of these is potentially part of the new personal flight network.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: The first Personal Plane<\/strong><br \/>\nThe first commercial pilotless small plane comes onto the market &#8211; it&#8217;s the first product from a conglomerate formed by Bombardier (the owners of Learjet)and VW, and now joined by Cirrus and Intel. The new product is dubbed the &#8216;Personal Plane&#8217; or PP &#8211; with echoes of the launch of the IBM Personal Computer 28 years before. The manufacturers claim that &#8220;the PP1 and the new global navigation network will do for air travel what the PC and the Internet did for business in the 1980s&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2011: Hertz and Avis open first plane franchises<\/strong><br \/>\nIn a grand convergence of executive jets (from Bombardier and others) and personal plane initiatives (such as Skycar and Cirrus Design), coupled with NASA and Vodafone&#8217;s air traffic control systems, small local airports have been liberated to participate in a growing new industry around the Personal Plane.<br \/>\nWhile the US initially harboured ideas of &#8216;a national air-taxi system\u2019, these nightmare visions of air-cabbies in the mold of New York taxi drivers or the Star Wars movies will not come to be \u2013NASA\u2019s software ensures that these PPs will have no pilots at all!<br \/>\nCommercial firms such as Hertz and Avis have beaten the large airlines and the government to this massive new &#8216;white space&#8217; market.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of 2011 there are PP hire outlets presence at 100 small US airports. Plans are in place for a similar launch in Europe within the next 12 months. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2015: Personal Planes become executive &#8216;first choice&#8217;<\/strong><br \/>\nPersonal Planes become dominant and preferred air travel of choice at the premium end of the travel market. Congestion at hubs is reduced as usage is limited to low-cost travel. Traditional air travel loses much of what little glamour remains.<\/p>\n<p>In the USA 500 local airports, 10% of the overall potential, are now a part of the PP network. European growth is surprisingly high with 300 local airports now established in just 12 months.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2020: Hertz voted Best Airline<\/strong><br \/>\n&#8220;The new air travel revolution&#8221;, as reported by CondeNast Traveller magazine, wins overwhelming approval from business and premium passengers.<br \/>\nThe big airports are today dominated by low-cost airlines offering extremely low fares and minimal service \u2013 flying from them has become a nightmare cattle run \u2013 not suitable for any busy executive.<br \/>\nAvis and Hertz are now being touted as the &#8220;new airlines&#8221; and their customer satisfaction ratings approach those not seen since Amazon scored the &#8216;highest ever&#8217; ratings back in 2003, a time at which airlines were rated right at the bottom of world customer satisfaction ratings.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1026\" src=\"https:\/\/futureworld.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ScenarioMatrix47.gif\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the holiday season gets into full swing, some of the major air hubs in Europe and the USA are comfortably quiet.

Feeling faint, he rested in the shade of some trees. He looked up at his wife, said &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel so good,&#8221; and fell over, unconscious &#8211; into the arms of a waiting paramedic.<\/p>\n<p>It was no accident that the medical team was waiting for him. As he had been climbing, tiny sensors located in his body had detected the early onset of his heart-attack and had sent a message to the medical call centre via the Global Positioning Satellite network. The medical team headed directly out to his location on the mountain, in anticipation of the pending heart-attack.<\/p>\n<p>The NanoBot technology required to perform the internal, automatic and remote analysis has received a great deal of attention in the press over the past few years but people were extremely reluctant to install any type of &#8216;robots&#8217; in their bodies. Despite the medical community&#8217;s persuasion, the public remained unconvinced.<\/p>\n<p>It was only earlier this year that Discovery Health, one of the world&#8217;s most dynamic medical aid and lifestyle companies, launched a new product offering dramatic cost savings on medical services &#8211; provided clients accepted an implanted NanoBot.<\/p>\n<p>Herman Olifant was tempted to be an early adopter and received his first year&#8217;s medical aid contribution free. This weekend, it saved his life on Table Mountain.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p>The applications of medical nanobots have been discussed. Uptake, however, will be slow without persuasive arguments to the public and innovative products from medical services companies. People need to know that the invasiveness and the hype is worth it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1950s: ECG enters service<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Electroencephalograph (ECG) utilises a variety of sensors to provide real-time information to medical officers (heart rate, pressure, oxygen levels, etc.) and was the first type of remotely operated medical telemetry to enter service. Hearing aid devices also were developed in the early 50s.<\/p>\n<p>Nobel-laureate, Richard Feynman, one of the pioneers of the Manhattan Project, discussed the idea of manufacturing devices molecule by molecule in 1959.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1960-80s: From pacemakers to nano technology<\/strong><br \/>\nThe first battery-operated pacemakers were implanted in the 1960s and operated for 18 months before needing replacement. The demand model entered service at the end of the sixties to provide stimulus only when necessary rather than at a continuous rate. Further innovations included electronic shielding so that radio frequency devices didn&#8217;t effect the pacemaker and computerisation allowing the pacemaker to monitor and react to any type of abnormal heart functions.<\/p>\n<p>Defibrillators, electric devices that stimulated a stopped heart, were developed. Blood oximeters entered service allowing quick evaluation of patient oxygen concentration in their blood supply.<\/p>\n<p>In the world of environmental research the first radio telemetry devices enter service to track wild populations of birds. In 1970 the first satellite tracking system was attached to a bear. The device weighed five kilograms.<\/p>\n<p>Nihon Kohden, a Japanese firm, utilised phone and satellite systems to monitor ECG systems around the world. At its peak, 32 centres throughout Japan and 2,000 satellite ECG labs and offices were interpreting 1.5 million ECGs per year. This enormous database was used to develop the first generation Cardiofax interpretive ECG machines.<\/p>\n<p>Eric Drexler coins the term: &#8220;nanotechnology&#8221; to describe materials and robots operating at the nano scale.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1980s the miniaturization of the electronics in the platform transmitter terminal (PTT) and the addition of on-board sensors to collect data on movement, temperature, altitude, humidity, heart rate and other factors revolutionized conservation ornithology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1990s: Digital ECG telemetry and the GPS<\/strong><br \/>\nPatients were given freedom of movement by cutting the wires linking them to ECG machines. This allowed heart patients to undergo physical therapy and recover faster.<\/p>\n<p>In 1993 the United States made their Global Positioning Satellite system available to the general public for free and on a continuous basis. This immediately unlocked a vast number of commercial opportunities, from surveying to time transfer and navigation systems.<\/p>\n<p>In 1993, PTTs weighing 28 grams\u2014about the size of a disposable lighter\u2014were attached to peregrine falcons to test the PTTs&#8217; capabilities on far-ranging species. In just two years, satellite studies revealed more about the falcon&#8217;s range and critical breeding, migratory and wintering habitats in North and South America than 25 years of conventional field studies and banding returns.<\/p>\n<p>Satellite transmitters operate on an ultra-high frequency, sending out an identification code and other information to satellites that collect data as they pass overhead. Ground-based computers use the Doppler effect\u2014shifts in the frequency of the received signal caused by the satellite&#8217;s movement\u2014to figure out the animal&#8217;s location to within several hundred metres.<\/p>\n<p>In 1999 the FCC established the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service, which designates specific radio frequency bands for medical telemetry in the US, including 608-614 MHz, 1395-1400 MHz and 1427-1429.5 MHz. Because neither land-mobile radios nor television are allowed to operate on these frequencies, this band is safe from the sources of RF interference that are common to medical telemetry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2000s: Nano technology initiatives<\/strong><br \/>\nPresident Bill Clinton of the US proposes a US$500 million a year National Nanotechnology Initiative. One day, such systems could lead to a &#8220;100 percent cure and prevention rate for every kind of cancer,&#8221; Clinton said.<\/p>\n<p>Critics contend that the constant motion of atoms and molecules makes atomic-scale machines nearly impossible to construct. Heisenberg&#8217;s uncertainty principle &#8211; the theory that the more you know about a subatomic particle&#8217;s position, the less you know about its momentum, and vice versa &#8211; also argues against nano machines. How can you manipulate atoms if their component pieces are so hard to find?<\/p>\n<p>The most potent attack came from Richard Smalley, Rice University&#8217;s Nobel laureate in chemistry. In 1999, Smalley was extolling the benefits of a world where &#8220;we learn to build things at the ultimate level of control, one atom at a time.&#8221; By 2001, he said, such control wouldn&#8217;t really be possible. The &#8220;fingers&#8221; we&#8217;d need to handle such a delicate task are too big, Smalley asserted in a Scientific American article.<\/p>\n<p>Hobbled by a divorce, and deep into theoretical computer science and abstract math studies, Drexler largely stayed out of public view in the face of such critiques for several years.<\/p>\n<p>The term &#8220;nanotechnology&#8221; becomes more abstract and is tagged to anything that is small and electronic.<\/p>\n<p>In 2000 the World Health Organisation (WHO) produced a report that jolted governments awake about a growing threat to public health. Obesity, it said, was an epidemic. In some countries, more than half the population is overweight. In December 2001, the United States surgeon-general, David Satcher, gave warning that obesity could soon kill as many people each year as smoking, and not because Americans are giving up cigarettes so fast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: The war against fat and sugar<\/strong><br \/>\nSwiss Re announces that people who are overweight will have to pay significantly higher life insurance premiums. &#8220;Unless the prevalence of obesity is brought under control, consumers will bear the ultimate cost,&#8221; said Ronald Klein, head of pricing at Swiss Re&#8217;s Life and Health business group. &#8220;As consumers&#8217; body mass index goes up, so too will their premiums,&#8221; he added in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Medical Aid companies follow rapidly and place restrictions against the obese.<\/p>\n<p>(see also the MindBullet &#8220;Fat and sugar &#8211; the new tobacco&#8221; &#8211; link below)<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005-8: Obesity becomes the biggest health challenge<\/strong><br \/>\nObesity-related cancer becomes the leading form of death in the developed world. Health insurance companies hold an international conference in Sydney, Australia to discuss strategies to reduce their risk. Lifestyle directed policies, such as those of Discovery Health, which link exercise and nutrition to premiums become popular.<\/p>\n<p>ECG devices are linked to pacemakers and PTT&#8217;s. The first devices weighed several kilograms and had a battery-life of less than a year. Today, technological breakthroughs have reduced the weight to 25 grams and the battery-life now is in the region of 15 years. Integration of mobile technologies with GPS are starting to make these NonoBots a reality for many.<\/p>\n<p>Health companies demand that clients install these to qualify for attractive new policies. There is an outcry over civil rights in the United States and demad for the active pacemaker components to be outlawed. The device is to remain passive and simply inform medical staff if any health-related problem is detected. European countries opt for the more active approach and support in legislation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: Commercial NanoBot Breakthrough<\/strong><br \/>\nHerman Olifant experiences a heart attack and is rescued by paramedics anticipating his crisis.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1026\" src=\"https:\/\/futureworld.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ScenarioMatrix82.gif\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Herman Olifant, fifty years old and heavily overweight, should have taken more care climbing the steep slopes of Platteklip Gorge on Table Mountain, Cape Town.

Thousands of consumers are protesting in a well-organized front against advertising.<\/p>\n<p>What started as a reaction against email and mobile phone spam, has evolved into negative sentiments against all forms of advertising. Their sentiments can be summed up as: \u201cIf I have not asked for it, then you have no right to advertise to me\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Adding fuel to fire are the high-tech filter controls built into consumer products such as phones, computers, game consoles and televisions which allow users to blot out any or all advertising.<\/p>\n<p>The advertising industry has been ignoring the signs for too long.

Add to this advancing technological capabilities and an unprecedented choice of often parity goods and services, with the associated increase in marketing and advertising messages<\/p>\n<p>Knowledge society and the changes in attitude to commercial messages.<\/p>\n<p>Bodies such as the FTC\u2019s Spam Forum and advertising and marketing regulatory bodies are all attempting to define spam and find ways of regulating commercial email practices.<\/p>\n<p>The GSM Association (GSMA) and European Commission have also taken a stance against SMS spamming. It is primarily affecting fixed networks, but with the success of text messaging over mobile networks, SMS spam is gaining impetus in the mobile space.<\/p>\n<p>Email spam and related pop-up ads are creating strong feelings of antagonism to traditional forms of advertising. The more consumers are exposed to spam and pop-up ads, the angrier they are about all forms of advertising. They actively support ad-filtering technologies and show overall erosion of trust in advertising and advertisers. There is increasing annoyance expressed at telemarketing practices, and a growing number of individuals are expressing anti-spam-like perceptions and sentiments about television and radio adverts on their weblogs.<\/p>\n<p>Due to technology large parts of marketing and specifically advertising practices have evolved into interpersonal, tailored messages based on so-called permission marketing principles. This has resulted in escalating marketer-initiated permission marketing. The direct result is increased intrusion on consumers\u2019 privacy. And the effect is that consumers are beginning to feel aggravated, cynical and are losing trust in companies.<\/p>\n<p>Social trends are inadvertently driving the marketing and advertising practices from a current push approach to a pull approach. In this age where marketing communication has turned into a feedback loop, the power has shifted to the consumer. The consumer\u2019s increasing ability to access information when it is needed or wanted means that a new marketing model of <b>\u2018By Invitation Only\u2019<\/b> is evolving. It is a consumer-initiated form of permission marketing, not the current marketer-initiated version.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003\/4: Spam results in Anti-Advertising mindset<\/strong><br \/>\nConsumers are increasingly using spam and pop-up ad filters to control the flow of unsolicited advertising to their computer screens. There is huge demand for technologies that filter out television commercials. Sales of products such as Tivo soar.<\/p>\n<p>A study by a market and technology research firm, Ferris Research, estimates that spam costs US corporations about US$8.9 billion in 2003, whilst European business would pay US$2.5 billion to deal with the problem.<\/p>\n<p>Vodafone helps its customers by introducing of a special filter in its network that provides better protection against unwanted SMS messages. This new technology temporarily denies access to all unidentified providers of SMS services until such providers have identified themselves and indicated that they will comply with a code of conduct Vodafone has for third parties.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst advertising organizations are preparing a spam policy, they are however circumventing the issue of pop-ups and other intrusive online ad formats. Research shows that consumers are even more annoyed by these ads than by unsolicited messages.<\/p>\n<p>The number of weblogs denouncing advertising, especially TV advertising is on the increase. Consumers voice their frustration at not having a choice as to whether to watch an advert or not.<\/p>\n<p>Anti-spam companies Brightmail and Cloudmark filtered over 85 billion email messages for companies in January 2004. Of these email messages, more than 60% were spam.<\/p>\n<p>Further statistics show a 2% increase in spam messages each month, trending towards an 80% spam element of all email sent by the end of 2004.<\/p>\n<p>Strong anti-marketing trend has been discovered in Japan by well-known trend watcher Loic Bizel. A Bathing Ape, a line of sweat shirts, baggy pants and T-shirts sporting a logo of a gorilla head has, without marketing or promotion, become one of the biggest fashion statements to surface from the Tokyo street scene<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Closing the \u2018Gates\u2019 on spam<\/strong><br \/>\nBill Gates announces the imminent death of spam via \u2018pioneering\u2019 Microsoft technology at the World Economic Forum.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers and the media however remain sceptical, arguing that the institutions that oppose spam, would not completely eradicate the threat since, by doing so, they would be eradicating the reason for their existence.<\/p>\n<p>The Consumer\u2019s Choice Council, actively involved in promoting practices such as ecolabeling, expands its influence to support consumers in their concerns and grievances about ever-increasing levels of permission-motivated contacts from marketers and advertisers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Developing World Opportunity<\/strong><br \/>\nThe increase in telephone lines in developing world markets over the past five years has required some $200 billion investments. In the meantime, growth of cellular use in Third World countries has risen exponentially. Corporations are now gearing up to further increase their presence in the developing world markets. Many, including Third World governments, feel it is payback time. The collective investments for ICT development in these markets is seen as a reason to now turn up the volume on R&amp;D, manufacturing and marketing activities, capitalising specifically on technological capabilities to reach and connect with many outlying and rural communities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: Mobile\/SMS Explosion<\/strong><br \/>\nAlmost 4 billion people on the planet now own a mobile phone. SMS marketing messages continue to boom reaching even rural communities, and the illiterate, with voice and graphic messages. Angry consumers blame their mobile phone operators for the inconvenience of spam-SMS. Law firms are encouraging users to become involved in mass-action suits against those who sent them unsolicited SMS\u2019s. In a desperate last-ditch effort the GSMA board is investigating ways that their members can collectively combat this pervasive problem on a global basis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: Skin-deep Marketing<\/strong><br \/>\nVeriChip\u2122 Corporation with their motto of \u201cminiaturised, implantable identification technology with multiple medical, security, and emergency applications\u201d, has been approached by a consortium of marketers who are attempting to gain access to individuals with implanted microchips. Their proposition is to \u201cexplore the potential benefits to the consumer when marketers have access to individual microchips and the data. The benefit will be a reduction in mass marketing exposure such as unwanted SMS and the provision of truly personalised information and services to individuals\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2010: From Permission to \u2018By Invitation Only\u2019<\/strong><br \/>\nThe signs of what may be called a \u2018mass collaboration technology\u2019 are evident. The marketing and advertising industry is currently fraught with an adversarial battle for consumer attention, but the consumer is winning the war. Many consumers carrying microchips also refuse to give marketers permission to access their information and to connect with them via their chips.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has made it possible for people to remain in control of their own personal space. And mass collaboration technology has made it possible for virtual communities of consumers, providers and intermediaries to emerge. The past five years have seen an unprecedented perfecting of information about goods and services, much as a result of consumer insistence and demand and resultant business compliance.<\/p>\n<p>People these days check the web before doing anything else when they want to buy something or need a service. They tap into people \u2018on the same team\u2019, virtual communities that have bought the same products or services, or those who make a living aggregating information from previous buyers. No more opting-in to a targeted marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<p>A slow turn of the tide towards an Invitational model of marketing is the very likely future, initially mainly in the developed world.

The Council of Europe adopts the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, prohibiting human germ line interventions. The prohibition on human cloning is added in 1998 (signed by 70% of member states by January 2000). President Bill Clinton announces a ban on federal funding for all human cloning. UNESCO adopts the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, prohibiting germ line interventions.<br \/>\nThe Korean Times reported that researchers at the Seoul National University had successfully cloned a calf using methods identical to those which produced &#8220;Dolly&#8221;. Researchers said Korea became the fifth country in the world to clone an adult animal after the United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand and the United States.<br \/>\nLegislation to ban cloning dies in US Senate after heavy lobbying by the biotech industry. Senators are told that human cloning wouldn&#8217;t be technically possible for &#8220;at least 10 years.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Scottish researchers who cloned Dolly discovered that her cells are six years older than her chronological age. The cell that was used to fertilize the sheep ovum that became Dolly came from an adult female sheep, aged 6 years. Apparently, cells have an internal mechanism which keeps track of its age. This mechanism was not reset to 0 when Dolly was conceived. She was, in essence, over 6 years old when she was born.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2000-4: The wooly mammoth and bunnies that glow in the dark<\/strong><br \/>\nA UFO-oriented religious sect, the Raelians, announces it will begin efforts to clone the dead child of an American couple.<\/p>\n<p>A team of French, American, Dutch and Russian palaeontologists successfully airlifted a male, 25 ton woolly mammoth from its grave in Siberia where it had been frozen for 20 000 years. It was almost complete except for its head which had been exposed to air in the past. Since the species has been extinct for over 10 000 years, some scientists have proposed that attempts be made to breed a living mammoth from DNA, sperm or cell nucleus retrieved from the carcass. A modern elephant ovum would be used, because it is the closest living relative to the mammoth.<\/p>\n<p>A child conceived in part to provide therapeutic tissues for an earlier-born sibling is born. Techniques of preimplantation genetic diagnosis are used to ensure that the child does not itself carry the disease. The press erroneously hails the child as the world&#8217;s first &#8220;designer baby.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In 2001, Scientists in Oregon announce the first transgenic primate, a rhesus monkey engineered with jellyfish genes. Eduardo Kac publicizes the creation of a rabbit genetically modified to glow green under florescent light as a work of art.<\/p>\n<p>US congressional hearings begin on legislation banning human cloning. The political struggle is quickly and erroneously defined as one between pro-life legislators who favour strong bans on both reproductive cloning and the creation of clonal embryos, and pro-choice legislators who favour a weak moratorium on reproductive cloning and an affirmation of the creation of clonal embryos.<\/p>\n<p>Advanced Cell Technology (ACT), a private biotechnology company based in Massachusetts, announces that its researchers have produced cloned human embryos. Most scientists consider the experiment a failure and the announcement premature at best.<\/p>\n<p>In February 2004 a team led by Dr Woo Suk Hwang and Dr Shin Yong Moon of Seoul National University obtained 242 eggs from 16 women. Of these, 176 were selected for cloning attempts. The cloning process yielded 30 blastocysts, from which they were able to extract 20 inner cell masses. One of these then grew into a line of stem cells.  The South Korean scientists had successfully cloned the first human embryos.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: The organ trade<\/strong><br \/>\nPresident John Kerry meets with Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss an international response to the potential trade in designer organs.

They are demanding an end to discriminatory legislation against cloning.  Some wish to clone themselves and many wish to clone loved-ones.  World leaders are unsympathetic until the rich place sanctions against them.  Targeted world leaders are refused medical services, sanitation and groceries from their companies.  They quickly fold and cloning is legalised.  There is public outrage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2012: The island of Dr Zavos<\/strong><br \/>\nTwo survivors wash up on the beach in Florida.  They report that their light aircraft crashed on a remote island.  The island was host to a strange scientist who was breeding bizarre hybrid humans.  The hybrids attacked the doctor and destroyed his laboratory.  The young couple survived the night and fled the island on a raft.  When investigators arrived they found that the island had been burned completely and no traces of the hybrids were found.  A destroyed, but highly sophisticated, laboratory was found.  The island was found to have belonged to Dr Panayiotis Zavos.<\/p>\n<p>Disney, a division of Sony, announces a theme park on a remote island in the Pacific where patrons will be able to see live dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous period.

Dr Curtis Strange is in attendance and explains that the clone is Bill Gates, including his memories and thought patterns.  Bill Gates (2) announces that he will be taking over Microsoft immediately and that Bill Gates (1) will be retiring to his mansion at Moon Base 1.  There is pandemonium and many executives flock to Strange Industries to purchase similar immortality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2017: The Hitler trials<\/strong><br \/>\nNovartis introduces a line of replacement organs (hearts, livers, kidneys and lungs) at a low price.

Most chemists used to believe it originated from the decomposition of organic matter \u2013 layers formed from the remains of dead animals. Hence the name \u2018fossil fuel\u2019. By definition its source was limited.<br \/>\n  That theory was plausible when oil wells were drilled into the fossil layers of the Earth\u2019s crust; but if oil comes from \u2018basement rock\u2019, a mile underground, it is well below the fossil layer.<br \/>\nDespite conventional wisdom around fossil fuels, the argument for non-biologically produced oil was not a new one. In 1951, the Russian scientist N.A Kudryavtsev, announced the theory that deep petroleum was produced abiotically. His theories were consolidated with the exploration of the oil fields of Dneiper-Donets in the early 1990s.<br \/>\nWorld-renowned geologist, C Warren Hunt\u2019s \u2018Anhydride\u2019 theory of 1996, asserted the idea of biogenesis from living microbial forms, as opposed to fossilized forms.<br \/>\nIf oil is constantly replenishing, why should it run out?<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: World&#8217;s biggest oil reserves discovered<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Athabasca Oil Sands Deposit in Northeastern Alberta, Canada, is found to be the largest source of petroleum in the world. Beneath Alberta\u2019s tar sands, at a depth of 7,200 ft, is the world\u2019s largest hydrocarbon deposit. Estimates believe the fields to hold 1.7 trillion barrels of oil. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Cracks appear in fossil fuel reasoning<\/strong><br \/>\nPeople begin to wonder if the Earth\u2019s quantities of oil and gas were much bigger than they had previously estimated \u2013 and whether supplies could be constantly replenished.<br \/>\nSome scientists start to speculate that petroleum could originate \u2018abiotically\u2019 from minerals at extreme temperature and pressure. The idea is that high temperature and pressure close to the Earth\u2019s mantle allow petroleum to form inorganically, rather than through biological degradation. Water forces it to the surface, as it has a greater density; the oil rises and gets trapped in layers of impermeable, sedimentary rocks.<br \/>\nScientists working at the Gas Resources Corporation, Houston, mimick conditions more than 100km below the Earth\u2019s surface, by heating marble, iron oxide and water to around 1,500\u00b0C and to 50,000 times the atmospheric pressure. The theory withstands tests put to it and settles many previously unresolved problems in petroleum science.<br \/>\nThe White Tiger Fields off the coast of Vietnam (discovered in the 1970s) become the centre of scientific attention as exploration companies drill for oil a mile into solid granite &#8211; deeper than ever before and way below the known fossil deposits. They start producing 338 000 barrels of oil per day. These new &#8216;non fossil&#8217; fields are estimated to hold a further 600 million barrels.<br \/>\nFortune Magazine runs their \u2018Oil without end?\u2019 article.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: New tests prove validity of &#8216;non-fossil&#8217; claims<\/strong><br \/>\nExtensive geological investigations by Shell and BP, and presented at (scientific smposium) in New York confirm that the source of new-found oil reserves is &#8220;not fossil&#8221;!<br \/>\nUS oil production plummets sharply as the effect of lower prices turns into economic realities. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Russian oil price wobble<\/strong><br \/>\nThis has been a bad year for oil. Not only have the theories of vast untapped reserves of oil been proven to be true, but Russian and Canadian producers have taken the unwritten laws of OPEC into their own hands by cutting the effective market price of oil to around US$15 a barrel. In an attempt to take an early competitive position against the anticipated future price of oil, they have established themselves as the supplier-of-choice for European business and alienated the OPEC cartel.<br \/>\nThe US is torn between traditional loyalties to Saudi Arabia (and, by implication, OPEC), their European business allies and their new best friend, Russia.<br \/>\nOPEC Holds onto their new US$25 price level but demand for OPEC oil is dwindling as Canadian reserves start to open up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: Political turbulence in Saudi Arabia<\/strong><br \/>\nAs oil prices have fallen, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s massive immigrant population has been encouraged to return to the Indian sub-continent as Saudis clamour for jobs. Young Saudis, now poorer than ever and with little chance of employment, seek alliances with extreme radical movements. Everyone is the enemy: the State, the King and America.<br \/>\nThe Norwegian economy, almost 50% of it still dependent on oil-related industries, declares itself to be heading for bankruptcy. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2010: Mid East terrorism spreads world-wide<\/strong><br \/>\nInternal terrorism sweeps the Middle East as oil economies falter, creating substantial economic, political and social instability in the whole region.<br \/>\nAmerican embassies are shut down as America switches completely to Canadian and Russian oil.<br \/>\nMajor terrorist attacks in San Francisco and London&#8217;s Mayfair.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2013: UN intervenes to create oil price stability<\/strong><br \/>\nThe airline industry loses half its passengers in just 12 months.

Each major  cycle causes the traditional jobs of the previous cycle to be commoditized, many automated and others outsourced to cheaper locations. The new economic cycle is hoped will create a plethora of new jobs. For example, agricultural workers once accounted for more than half the workforce, today less than 3% of the workforce produce all of the US&#8217;s agricultural output. Manufacturing jobs once accounted for more than half the jobs, and now account for just 14%.<br \/>\nJob losses are a reality globally, not just in America. The belief has been that that problem in first world countries has been caused by jobs being exported to low-wage economies, but that&#8217;s only part of the story. The real cuprit has been unprecedented improvements in productivity.<br \/>\nProductivity gains for the past few years have been running at more than 3% p.a. (versus an anticipated growth rate of 2% p.a.) &#8211; and versus the modest 1,5% p.a. annual growth rate during the past 30 years. The global economy is destroying jobs at a much higher rate than we are able to create them. These efficiency gains are especially evident in large corporations, and that&#8217;s where the major job losses have been occuring.<br \/>\nThe world\u2019s 20 largest economies lost 22 million manufacturing jobs from 1995 to 2002, this includes China which lost 15 million jobs in that period and America\u2019s loss of 2,7 million jobs in just the past three years. A 1% growth in US productivity translates directly into 1,3 million jobs being lost per annum. America\u2019s productivity is at an all-time high. In fact globally production is up 30% more over the same period.<br \/>\nTechnology, and especially, info-tech has been a key catalyst. The big surprise of the increasingly productive, info-tech fuelled, friction-free, nowhere-to-hide economy, is that instead of working less, we end up working more in order to compete effectively. Compounding the problem, the new jobs that are being created tend to be less well paid than the old.<br \/>\nThe job-rich boom starting in 1994 created unprecedented prosperity. This made the downturn of 2000 all the more stark by comparison. Today, although economic recovery in America is looking quite real, the jobs are not following the same curve. A truly deep shift has been wrought by digital technology and created a really new economy. Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel: &#8220;The world has arrived at a rare strategic inflection point where nearly half its population \u2013 living in China, India, Russia \u2013 has been integrated into the global market economy, many of them highly educated workers, who can do just about any job in the world. We\u2019re talking about three billion people&#8221;.<br \/>\nThat combined with the fluidity for much of the worlds work to be done anywhere, defines the magnitude of the problem. Any thinking, educated worker need to consider this and its impact on the availability of work and careers in the future. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Soaring economic productivity and growing off-shoring<\/strong><br \/>\nContinued job losses and in particular the exporting of jobs has become a political hot potato. White-collar unemployment peaks at an unprecedented 16% of the total unemployed. They are better educated than ever before but are suffering from a double whammy: technology-led productivity gains and re-location of jobs off-shore. Only four in five graduates from top B-schools like Harvard are getting any job offers, about 16% of graduates now don\u2019t get any job offers. The outlook is that 3,3 million professional American jobs will move offshore in the next ten years or so. The once prized MBA is becoming a commodity to be outsourced to the lowest cost supplier.<br \/>\nCarly Fiorina, CEO, HP is quoted as saying &#8220;There is no job that is America\u2019s god-given right anymore&#8221;. This seems to sum up future realities.<br \/>\nUnemployment has become an upper-class problem, gaining new prominence and becoming a pressure point in politics. A powerful lobby group has formed which calls itself the \u201cLet\u2019s keep Americans working\u201d campaign.<br \/>\nIt is not that there is no growth in jobs. Some sectors like restaurants, education, financial services and health care jobs are growing, but these tend to be much lower paying jobs. Current job growth favours low-paid jobs &#8211; and low-wage economies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Crunched in the supply-and-demand cycle<\/strong><br \/>\nThe off-shoring trend in America is deepening; latest research indicates that as much as 14 million service jobs may be shipped overseas.<br \/>\nThere are too many people with the same qualifications competing fro the same jobs worldwide. An over-supply develops and the price drops. Many professional white-collar jobs are at risk from being off-shored. Millions of administrative and financial jobs are streaming from the USA to other parts of the world. China and India are geared to grow on the back of the commoditization phase of the economic life-cycle. These jobs are moving to the cheapest source of supply. Theoretically, there is nothing wrong with this.<br \/>\nWhat is not working is that the new jobs are not being created as part of a new economic cycle and so take up the slack of highly qualified, but unemployed, engineers, scientists, designers, accountants, MBA\u2019s, marketers etc.<br \/>\nOne reason for this appears to be lack of venture capital to feed the new cycle.<br \/>\nThere has been a lot of the noise from the \u2018Let\u2019s keep America working\u2019 campaign. It has high visibility but little effect. It does not seem like a problem that politicians can fix. The campaign itself seems to be stuck in the old \u2018entitlement\u2019 mindset and appears to be doing very little to assess and deal with the fundamental issues.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: The new boom is late<\/strong><br \/>\nRealization dawns that we have a new problem. The new boom is not happening on time as it is supposed to.<\/p>\n<p>The new technology sectors, bio-tech and nano-tech, are in good shape and set to boom. Both have seen many new innovations with major potential for investment. The problem appears to be in the venture capital sector which has hit an all time low in terms of sentiment. There seems to be a deep-seated fear of commitment still hanging over from the dot.com collapse. <\/p>\n<p>Tens of billions of dollars are in funds waiting to be invested but relatively few investments are flowing. The IPO rate, although somewhat improved, also lags significantly behind the curve of the Internet boom. Investors seem to be so worried about choosing the wrong wave that they are choosing to do nothing at all. They seem to have forgotten that they make money even when 90% of their investments fail. The key to success has always been to invest in many startups to see what clicks, not to attempt a perfect science. Can they possibly regain the ways of old?<\/p>\n<p>Various new growth points are emerging for bio-tech. Britain is becoming the new cradle of the bio-tech movement.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that American technology-related firms are feasting on a talent glut not seen before. Where the best talent came at a premium a few years ago, there are now ten great applications for each position. It is again a question of what doesn\u2019t kill you, makes you stronger. <\/p>\n<p>Corporate America seems to be hiring a new breed of graduate, there is a distinct disinterest in B-school graduates and the top recruiters are visiting the top Arts Graduate Schools. More firms are realizing that, to differentiate their goods and services in today\u2019s overstocked, materially abundant marketplace, they have to make their offerings remarkable \u2013 physically beautiful and emotionally compelling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Is America asleep on the job?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe efficiency and productivity drive continues to deepen. Corporations are focusing on that and getting the job done wherever it can be done best, and for the lowest price. Corporations are not the ones to create new markets and new jobs. For them it is too early in the new economic cycles. This is the traditional role of entrepreneurs, small companies and venture capitalists &#8211; think Microsoft, FedEx, Amazon and eBay.<\/p>\n<p>It is the most competitive marketplace ever. This is the post-consumer society, in developed countries everyone has everything they need and much of what they want. They are smarter and much more demanding. Future differentiation is in design and innovation.<\/p>\n<p>All developed countries have reason to be worried. Opportunities abound but they are not geographically bound. An interconnected world, especially driven by ubiquitous broadband continues to be the catalyst for this major global shift, but is no longer a differentiator for anyone. The game has moved up a notch. There has been a marked progression in the globalization of skills and expertise \u2013 all the way from off-shoring lowly paid factory jobs, to off-shoring a multitude of professional jobs whether they be accountants or designers. What is the next rung on the ladder? Product innovation, brand building, management?<\/p>\n<p>A competitive advantage for America has long been its entrepreneurial ability and the complimentary venture capital. This has allowed it to take advantage of skills and innovation and to create the major waves which fueled its economy. This was the engine of the American dream, and it has stalled. Will America get it right this time? That is the burning question, not only for Americans but also for the world economy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: The search for the next big thing<\/strong><br \/>\nA powerful global debate has started: What exactly is the next big thing to be? Where will the next economic growth cycle begin? Bio-tech and nano-tech have shown huge promise but have delivered neither the unbridled economic growth nor the jobs.<br \/>\nI am out of work and need to re-train, but at what? What will be the new skills demanded?<br \/>\nWhat courses should my kids take in school, college and university in order to relevant when they graduate?<br \/>\nIt really is not all that obvious what the next economic cycle is likely to be. The debate continues as the world economy slumps.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1026\" src=\"https:\/\/futureworld.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ScenarioMatrix84.gif\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Disappointing employment growth numbers out of the United States highlights the deepening employment crisis.

The LG iSpy Homenet fridge also won the Innovative Marketing award from the Global Society of Marketers last month.<\/p>\n<p>It works just like any other fridge, keeping food fresh and drinks cool, but the convergence of new technologies makes this appliance a communications medium rather than an ice box. The front panel lights up to form a big-screen TV, while Terfenol actuators provide concert quality sound. Besides being connected to the Internet and Freeview digital TV, the iSpy has an integrated Sony PlayStation and can wirelessly scan all products stored in the kitchen, search for best prices and stock availability, and prompt you to re-order.<\/p>\n<p>But it is the ability of the iSpy fridge to stop unwanted advertising that has earned it such acclaim. Since free media programs invariably contain many advertising messages, iSpy will automatically disable adware for products that you have already bought, and filter out spam and subliminal \u2018nano-ads\u2019 from programmes, online games and messages. It will even monitor your household\u2019s lifestyle to allow only permission-based advertising relevant to your family. Of course, you can always pay online to block all those annoying ads!<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><b>Background<\/b><br \/>\nThe negative reaction to spam and unwanted advertising, and the increasing level of sophistication in consumerism has made conventional advertising public enemy number one, yet most media services rely on advertising revenues to subsidise their news and information content and distribution costs. The model that suggests itself is similar to freeware on the internet \u2013 free services contain embedded advertising, while pay-per-view and subscription services are ad-free.<br \/>\nThis situation is further complicated by product placement and embedded messages in movies and online games. Coupled to this is the whole issue of digital rights, file swapping of music and video, and the high cost of copyrighted entertainment. Many consumers will happily endure advertising to receive free movies, music and programs, while others would sooner pay for a premium service that is free of advertising. And if they have paid, they have the right to insist on \u2018clean\u2019 content.<br \/>\nThe massive use of electronic media and devices has encouraged advertisers to infiltrate all methods of communication and entertainment with sometimes subliminal messages and marketing, prompting a backlash from consumers similar to the universal condemnation of spam. At the same time, advertisers are desperately seeking effective ways of getting their message across to consumers without provoking a negative reaction. The truth is that consumers do not mind advertising that is relevant and considered useful information, especially if it does not intrude on their lifestyle, is not unsolicited, or offers a financial benefit in terms of free services. The challenge is to find the means and methods to combine these disparate requirements into a win-win solution.<br \/>\nDuring 1992, the Campaign for Advertising, was created in response to continuing legislative threats to commercial free speech and unfavourable consumer attitudes towards advertising. The Campaign has gathered more than $600 million in pro-bono media time and space.<br \/>\nIn 2001 spam became a global problem and products such as TiVo let people zap TV ads. Napster created the infrastructure to enable people to swap music &#8211; for free.<br \/>\nDuring 2002 Kazaa took over from Napster &#8211; and expanded services to include movies. This time it was based on a peer-to-peer model, creating a network of more than 80 million users, almost impossible to shut down.<br \/>\nIn 2003 the first laws were enacted to prohibit spam and outlaw file swapping. Pop-ups become a global nuisance. Freeview launched in the UK. Apple dominates with iPod and launches iTunes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Consumer choice in advertising<\/strong><br \/>\nMicrosoft vows to kill spam, signs digital rights agreement with Disney.<br \/>\nSony and others start selling music and video over the internet. TiVo and Replay allow 10% of US TV ads to be \u2018zapped\u2019. DVD copying becomes rife worldwide. The recording industry fails to stem the tide. Microsoft announces support for the Media Centre PC, which combines the functions of TiVo, DVD and MP3 player \/ recorder, game console and broadband connection for TV displays. Wal-Mart institutes RFID marking of all major product lines. Akimbo launches an alternative to ad-ridden TV channels.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: No more ads please, except for free<\/strong><br \/>\nConsumers insist on having ad-free PayTV services. Freeview continues to be the fastest growing media service in Europe. Pop-ups are outlawed. Disney launches \u2018free\u2019 movies on the internet, but with adware agreement. Microsoft provides technology for removing adware with online payment. Sony Entertainment follows suit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Advertisers introduce nano-ads<\/strong><br \/>\nFaced with increasing commercial losses, TV networks allow the introduction of ads lasting only 90 milliseconds. Although too short to consciously interrupt programming, the nano-ads prove to have a sub-conscious advertising effect.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Nano-ads come under fire<\/strong><br \/>\nAdvertisers perfect nano-ad technology, allowing them to be broadcast virtually continuously without interrupting normal programming, using only part of the available broadcast spectrum. Scientific studies fail to prove that they are hypnotic or more effective than conscious advertising, but some health studies indicate they might be responsible for increased cases of insomnia, anxiety and epilepsy, particularly in young children, although teenagers appear to be unaffected.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: Adware disabled by product purchase<\/strong><br \/>\nMicrosoft develops software for disabling product-specific adware from compatible devices, based on proven product purchase. For a premium price, this includes nano-ads. Wireless product tagging enables this to be automated by simply placing the product within the scan vicinity of the ad-jammer. LG licenses this technology for their latest internet fridge, the iSpy, which simultaneously provides wanted marketing messages and media content to its owners.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At the annual International Advertising Awards festival the overall winner of the Grand Prix was, for the first time, an ad for a refrigerator.

Therefore we produce more insulin to remove the glucose, which is far more than we need to power the body. What we don&#8217;t need gets converted and stored as fat. Eventually we run out of insulin and become diabetic. Once we become obese the risk of diabetes is 77 times higher.&#8221;<br \/>\nPatrick Holford, founder of London&#8217;s Institute of Optimum Nutrition<br \/>\n<strong>1999: Tobacco feels the pain<\/strong><br \/>\nIn a ground-breaking legal settlement, the US tobacco industry settles with consumers, promising to pay a total of US$206 billion, in annual part-payments until the year 2025 and an up-front payment of US$ 13 billion. This is in addition to the US$40 billion settlement already agreed with four separate states.<br \/>\nAdditional conditions include changed labelling, the ban of ads at sports events, brands on promotional T-shirts and association with cartoon characters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Fat and sugar in the news<\/strong><br \/>\nThe negative effects of fat and sugar start becoming part of the public debate. A Fortune magazine cover shouts out: &#8220;Fat, the next tobacco&#8221;. It is realised that the effects of sugar include high blood pressure and higher levels of specific fats called triglycerites. New Scientist: &#8220;Sugar is the new fat&#8221; and claims that sugar can be as bad for your heart as saturated fat. <\/p>\n<p>It is estimated by one researcher that more than 60% of Americans are obese. Europeans are somewhat leaner on average. There is a strong drive away from saturated fats (such as steak, butter, cream and chicken skin) by switching to olive oil and polyunsaturated fats (including marine fish oils). The sales of diet products becomes one of the fastest growing industry segments.<\/p>\n<p>The Atkins diet grows in popularity, recommending high fat, high protein and low carbohydrate foods. On 8 April, Dr Robert Atkins (the originator of the revolutionary diet introduced back in 1972 &#8211; going against almost all current wisdom, his book becomes a consistent top seller for decades) dies quietly after a fall on his way to work. At this stage there are hundreds of franchised Atkins food lines in supermarkets across America. Later in the year, after an enforced autopsy, doctors state that he might have survived the fall but for his obesity! <\/p>\n<p>There is an explosion of diabetes in many first world countries. Unhealthy diets, high in fats  and sugar, are blamed.<\/p>\n<p>McDonalds start salad meals. Burger King offers low carbo burgers (without the bun!) in response to demands from Atkins followers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Government enters the fray<\/strong><br \/>\nIn November 2003, the Austrian health service announces plans for a &#8220;fat tax&#8221;. Fat Austrians may have to pay larger health service contributions to cover the fact they are more likely to visit the doctors.<br \/>\nIn February 2004, British government announces plans for a &#8220;fat tax&#8221; plan to tackle obesity. Dairy products such as full-fat milk, cheese and butter could be targeted with additional VAT, along with junk food and fizzy drinks. Cigarette-style health warnings could also be slapped on food and drinks in a bid to improve Britons\u2019 health.<br \/>\nBritish ministers have become increasingly concerned about mounting rates of obesity, particularly among children. Heart disease has overtaken cancer as the country\u2019s biggest killer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Fast food industry reshapes strategy<\/strong><br \/>\nMcDonalds and Burger King are running scared.<br \/>\nFast Food upstart Kwik n&#8217; Good is revolutionizing eating habits. The name is perhaps corny, but their food is getting rave reviews from both young and old &#8211; a first in the fast food industry. Kwik n&#8217; Good has grown to more than 1000 outlets in the US and Europe and their 2006 plan calls for 10 000 new outlets world-wide. Their value proposition &#8211; low calorie meals containing no fat and little sugar and slow-release carbo.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Class action suits target sugar and fat<\/strong><br \/>\nSugar takes centre stage with pressure groups after a continued explosive growth in the number of new diabetics.<br \/>\nKwik n&#8217; Good becomes the world&#8217;s most successful fast food enterprise. Accepted into schools, hospitals and universities in a way that McDonalds could only have dreamed about.<br \/>\nAmongst the growing obesity epidemic, a war about GM food labelling erupts between Europe (wants complete detailed labelling) and the USA (&#8220;let&#8217;s be reasonable&#8221;).<br \/>\nClass action lawyers start rubbing their hands as tests show conclusively that you can become addicted to junk food. The combination of fat and sugar is shown to cause changes in the brain that are similar to those from heroin addiction. Consumers are ready to say that they were never warned about these dangers. The first suits are aimed at fast food companies and food producers. With combined world revenues approaching US$ 1 trillion they are a ripe target. US companies represent seven of the world&#8217;s top ten and are obvious targets. Kraft Foods, General Foods, PepsiCo and Coca Cola are prized targets. Nestle, the world number one producer with more than 500 plants world-wide, and Unilever are tipped to be the first non-US targets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: First Judgements<\/strong><br \/>\nCoca Cola is the first company to be hit with a judgement. It was seen as an easy target due to the relatively simple case against a &#8216;pure sugar&#8217; drink, even though it emerged from court papers that, ironically, sugar-free Diet Coke had become Coke&#8217;s biggest seller. In a judgement touted by the New York Times as &#8216;a bitter sugar pill&#8217;, Coca Cola is ordered to pay $20 billion dollars over the next decade in the USA alone. Half of this will go towards the estimated US$100 billion annual healthcare costs on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of obesity.<br \/>\nInternational law suits are still pending. The first &#8216;fat&#8217; case seems likely to be McDonalds. This tort case will be based on their dominance of the US fast food market over the past decades and their overall impact on American eating habits. Their advertising history is coming under close scrutiny as is their marketing program into US schools during the 1980s.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: Product labelling gets graphic<\/strong><br \/>\nUniversal condemnation of sugar and fat hits new highs with pressure from consumer groups dominating government attempts to control the food situation.<br \/>\nFood labelling has become the norm through voluntary actions by producers to win consumer trust and retain market share.<br \/>\nGovernments add their voice to the labelling debate by forcing labels to include dire warnings and graphic photos of the diseases that could result.

By September concerns about the real reasons for the war and the lack of evidence of WMD (weapons of mass destruction) create a massive break of trust between leaders and the population. The rift that started with Bush and Blair extends to other leaders &#8211; in a sense heralding the end of the politician as hero figure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: US economy stumbles<\/strong><br \/>\nUnemployment soars even as the US economy expands &#8211; more than 5 million people are out of work by year-end.<br \/>\nBush narrowly wins the Nov 2004 election amongst much dissatisfaction. It now appears that the US will show a $1 trillion trade deficit by the end of 2005. Despite his victory at home, Bush is now confirmed by the international press as the most unpopular president in American history.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: The first lady steps in<\/strong><br \/>\nHillary Clinton announces that she is &#8220;deeply dissatisfied&#8221; with the American political system, health care, taxation and its focus on the enemy \u2018out there\u2019 \u2013 she announces that she will run for President in 2008 and that \u2018the enemy is us\u2019!<br \/>\nAs terrorism and the war in Iraq escalate, Bush retreats to the politically conservative heartland and supports many initiatives that distance him from the more liberal west and east coast voters. On the back of restrictions on scientific research and development, the USA loses more than ten thousand scientists to Europe, China and India.<br \/>\nVanity Fair magazine runs an article on &#8220;Bush&#8217;s Ten Commandments: The conservative view of the future USA&#8221;. Although a lampoon of life under Bush, many of these scenarios have already come to pass. Examples: Thou shalt not use the words &#8216;evolution&#8217;, &#8216;cloning&#8217;, &#8216;gay&#8217; or (female) &#8216;breast&#8217;; Thou shalt not practice therapeutic stem cell technology here!<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: USA structures begin to crack<\/strong><br \/>\nPolitical infighting over solutions to the on-going Middle East conflict, the economy, gay rights, violent crime, gun control and health care, creates a complete stand-off in terms of a future political strategy. Bush and Schwarzenegger are at very public loggerheads \u2013 Arnold claims: &#8220;We could fix these problems if we could only focus on California&#8217;s needs, and the region around us \u2013 the rest of the country is dragging us down. We\u2019re different \u2013 we need our own goals and strategies&#8221;.<br \/>\nA powerful new book published in Hawaii, drums up support to give Hawaii back to its indigenous people, painting the US as colonial agressors.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Global intervention in the USA<\/strong><br \/>\nThe International Monetary Fund warns that the excessive fiscal deficits in the US could hurt the long-term sustainability of the global economy. Together with the World Bank the IMF intervenes to counter the country&#8217;s spiralling debt and develop a strategy to curb spending. Although unpopular, this action underlines the inescapable reality of the US economic black hole.<br \/>\nThe resulting internal political turbulence creates 3 power blocs, centred around the East and West coasts and a geographic centre around the conservative mid-West. MTV and the study of evolution is banned in the Central USA.<br \/>\nThe Bush family is increasingly portrayed as the epitome of this dynasty. Caricatures show the Bush clan as \u2018Dallas 2007\u2019 with Barbara Bush cast as Miss Ellie and George junior as JR (whom he is starting to resemble in real life).<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: A promise of fast-path delivery<\/strong><br \/>\nAs an integral part of her election promises, Hillary Clinton states that she will support self-determination for the three power-blocs in the US to enable them to compete effectively in world markets. Examples of successful splits on the part of Czechoslovakia in 1994 and Russia are used to justify this thinking. Underpinned by an economic union and a common currency, this \u2018New USA\u2019 is heralded as the best of all possible worlds and as an escape from years of economic stagnation and joblessness.<br \/>\nCynics claim that this is an &#8216;impossible&#8217; view: legally unconstitutional and unimplementable. The proponents gain so much grass roots support that the dream enters the realm of the &#8216;possible&#8217; and voters begin to vote with their hearts.<br \/>\nClinton wins a landslide victory in November. She immediately sets to work to implement her election promises. She crafts a surprising alliance with a disconsolate Bush and an ultra-keen Schwarzenegger. The aim is to fast-track the required legal and constitutional reforms. Never have the American public seen reforms at such a pace. US Consumer spending for the year-end season is the highest in a decade. Optimism for a brighter future is running high based on little but &#8216;irrational exuberance&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: The New Musketeers: Hillary, George and Arnold<\/strong><br \/>\nOn January 15, three new presidents are inaugurated in simultaneous ceremonies.

With vastly different attitudes towards health care, science, international relations and terrorism, for each of their battered empires this is a fresh new start.<br \/>\nIn April, unprecedented constitutional changes are promulgated and implemented to enable the country to be split and run as three completely independent countries. It is proposed that the legislative and economic powers of the old &#8216;states&#8217; be severely restricted within each country for the sake of efficiencies. Power is limited but centralized (along the best thinking of network design) within each of the 3 new countries.

The occasion was our Chinese grandmother&#8217;s 80th birthday. The extended families got together around the dinner table and the conversation never stopped. What is so special about this? Well, other than my husband, our kids and myself, none of the extended family are multi-lingual. We had dreamed of getting the family together like this for years but had to wait for technology to come to our aid.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The best part is that we were hardly aware of the technology at all. Using the tiniest mobile phone on the planet, the SonyEricsson E1, small enough to be tucked away unobtrusively in the ear, we were blissfully unaware of the smart technology required to accomplish all of this. The translations were natural, fluent and fast, and our voices sounded, well, exactly like our own voices. At the press of a button we crossed the chasm of communication.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What we experienced in our family demonstrate the potential of removing one of the toughest barriers to international trade and tourism, that of language.

(IDC) estimated in 2001, to be a $378 billion market for the translation of online text. This certainly became a growth driver in the universal translation market.<\/p>\n<p>Well-known names like IBM putting its energy and money into this sector did much to highlight its enormity, adding instant credibility to this growth sector. The benefits were clear, more than 80% of online content was in English, whilst almost 70% of all PC users did not have English as a first language.<\/p>\n<p>The goal was to translate everything ranging from website content, documents, forms and archives to words, phrases and email messages in real-time or delayed formats.<\/p>\n<p>Globalisation and open markets also meant that huge numbers of people and vast amounts of trade was taking place between people from different areas and with different languages.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge is far beyond just the translation of words and phrases for specific contexts like travelling. To make it widely applicable requires the contextual translation of the written word, as well as the real-time translation of the spoken word, in any situation. This is much more difficult. It requires semantic analysis, extracting the most likely meaning of text or speech and then expressing the same idea in the other language.<\/p>\n<p>A simple example to illustrate the perils of double translation:<br \/>\nI asked for a translation of &#8220;Out of sight, out of mind&#8221;, after the double translation it came back as &#8220;Invisible idiot&#8221; (Please refer to the end of this section for a few more examples)<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: IBM sets benchmark<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>MIT Technology Review profiles computer scientist Yuqing Gao as part of their feature &#8217;10 Emerging Technologies that will change your world&#8217;. Working out of IBM\u2019s Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY, Yuqing Gao is bilingual \u2014 and so is her computer. She demonstrates the current capabilities of the device to translate Mandarin Chinese to American English via a personal digital assistant (PDA). The context is a medical interview between doctor and patient and the translation is delivered in a pleasant female voice.   The ultimate goal, she says, is to develop universal translation software that gleans meaning from phrases in one language and conveys it in any other language, enabling people from different cultures to communicate.<\/p>\n<p>Work in this field is accelerating and Gao is at the forefront. The focus is on the use of mathematical models and natural-language processing techniques to make computerized translation more contextually accurate and more efficient.<\/p>\n<p>This is different from speech recognition and synthesis. The main drivers behind the research is currently coming as a result of global business and security needs.<\/p>\n<p>Alex Waibel, associate director of Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Language Technologies Institute, which supports several parallel efforts in the field, attributes much of the maturing of universal translation to the advances in automatic learning, computing power and available data for translation.<\/p>\n<p>The challenges are to convert speech to text, making sense of that text (contextually to the conversation) and then to use speech synthesis technology to output the translation. This is enormously complex. In addition the system has to be adaptable to new situations since no conversation happens in exact phrases.<\/p>\n<p>IBM is acknowledged as setting the bar in this field. In the above application it achieves 90% accuracy and has around 2000 words in its vocabulary.<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to support &#8216;Any language to Any language&#8217; translation<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Pivotal partnership<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>IBM and Sony Erickson announce their advanced earphone\/voice and microphone\/speech technology which is delivered as part of the latest mobile phone devices which also carries the translation software. For anyone familiar with Hitch Hiker\u2019s guide to the galaxy you will remember Babelfish, a little fish that you put in your ear which translated everything. This new gizmo is getting there. Although the complete device does not yet fit into the ear, it is very discreet, contains some clever directional and programmable sound technology which makes it a boon in noisy environments such as restaurants and the voice is very soothing and humanlike. Many future improvements are planned for better speech recognition and really good matching for the speaker\u2019s voice as it delivers the conversation to the receiver\u2019s earpiece.<\/p>\n<p>The ultimate aim of SonyEricsson is to make a mobile phone small enough in its entirety to fit into the ear in order make it unobtrusive and completely hands-free and natural,  using a voice command interface.<\/p>\n<p>A pivotal outcome from the collaboration between these two companies is a commitment to open standards to ensure that as many devices as possible can be used to collaborate.<\/p>\n<p>A significant degree of sophistication has been reached in text translation and several online services are available. The most accurate is the service from IBM.<\/p>\n<p>Another key deliverable to turn speech translation into a reality is to perfect the voice interface between humans and appliances, machines and systems. To eventually provide accurate input to the translator and a natural, flowing conversation, an accurate voice interface is essential. Huge advances have been made in this field.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Business wins in this phase<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There have been significant advances in semantic analysis and the pool of semantic concepts have increased dramatically,  particularly in the areas of high focus such as healthcare, travel and security. It is becoming easier to hook up a new language to the network. For example instead of having to program separate Chinese-Arabic and English-Arabic translators, you need only map Arabic to the existing conceptual representations.<\/p>\n<p>A high degree of accuracy and sophistication has been achieved in universal text translation and many specialised application suppliers have emerged, based on industries and purpose. So, for example, legal, business negotiations and international trade and healthcare are very well represented.<\/p>\n<p>Business wins. In particular the multi-nationals who have been battling with corporate knowledge dissemination. It has been a real issue for cross-language teams who have to work in languages that are not their first language. The prohibitive cost of competent translators made this option impossible for most organisations. Translation of text (email, documents etc.) is becoming very usable. The general work in expanding the semantic concepts pool has helped enormously, but large companies are also finding that by adding their own semantic concepts they can indeed move faster and also create more clarity for their employees. The breakthrough this year has been in supporting speech translation for an increasing number of these semantic concept databases to facilitate business communication.<\/p>\n<p>The priority for speech applications being deployed are driven by a number of factors such as ease of translation, commercial opportunity and, very importantly, National interest. Security has become a top priority with specialised applications being released in this field. In Airport security for example each immigration and security official at every International American Airport is now equipped with a PDA based interview set. The PDA also runs other applications, which is integrated to this interview set, a camera to capture and match the individual to a real-time database, demographic data, travel history, stress indicators based on culture and nationality and so on. The languages are still limited but expanding month on month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Niche markets benefit<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many applications are available for text translation, but speech continues to develop in its niche markets. This is still hugely important as one looks at the benefits being derived in areas like healthcare. Very few language barriers now exist in this field. Most healthcare professionals in multi-cultural environments have access to very smart universal translation systems, running on PCs, mobile phones and PDAs.<\/p>\n<p>Distance learning is another area where translation plays a key role and text translation has developed to the point where it is applied quite effectively, extending the reach of many of the distance learning organisations.<\/p>\n<p>Great progress has been made in developing application-specific dialog engines, conversing in natural language over multiple channels and doing this in the context of previous conversations. Some of these systems are already at work in distance learning, managing much of the voice interaction with students. This year has also seen the mainstream adoption of systems for customer service. This has become a real, low cost and very effective alternative to \u2018offshore outsourcing of call-centres\u2019. Several major Indian outsourcing companies have commented on the impact this is having on their businesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: Niche to mass market<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Universal Translation applications are proliferating in specialised application areas. Mostly these applications have been deployed in structured environments and aimed at one to one interaction.<\/p>\n<p>A vast expansion of the available semantic concepts and great advances in the speech recognition and voice technologies has the potential to deliver popular, mass market applications. Business is once again the big winner. Because of a more manageable semantic concepts pool they are able to start using speech translation on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p>Many embedded technology deals have been signed ensuring universal translation solutions will be supported on your device of choice.<\/p>\n<p>New market- and marketing opportunities open, customers are starting to expect and enjoy a cultural sensitivity that was difficult to achieve in a world mostly serviced in the English language.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2010: Translation and Mobile converge<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>SonyEricsson has relentlessly been driving down the size of their mobile phone devices and they have just released the SonyEricsson E1, to great market acclaim. The E1 tucks neatly into the ear and is voice command driven.<\/p>\n<p>In Universal translation technology the real breakthrough in this year has been to optimise the technologies to facilitate real, complex conversational applications. Paradoxically it is the social interaction which has proven to be the most complex because it is so variable and diverse.<\/p>\n<p>The IBM and SonyEricsson universal translation service &#8216;Onevoice&#8217; is launched globally. This highly sophisticated service supports many different areas of specialisation, but its biggest differentiator, is its mass-market potential. There are a number of mega-deals mooted between &#8216;Onevoice&#8217; and the mobile and fixed-line operators.<\/p>\n<p>It is now possible for everyone to be multi-lingual, to a very real degree. Discreet technology, great contextual semantic translation and a broad base of social semantic concepts have been mapped. A wide variety of languages and good voice matching makes the conversations of persons to persons very real and very personal.

It&#8217;s the year 2020. You&#8217;re relaxing at home. Your grandchild is riding your knee like an imaginary horse.<\/p>\n<p>Suddenly his eyes light up and he says to you: &#8220;Hey gramps! Mom just told me that back in 2000 you used to wash your clothes by boiling them in water. She says that you had a big white metal box in the kitchen, with a round window in it. You could watch your clothes going round like television. Cool! Hey, you didn&#8217;t really put blue gooky chemicals on your clothes, boil them and hang them out in the garden to dry? Did you?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Yes we did. And we still do. But all that is about to end. A product launched by Sony this week is about to turn the washing and ironing chore on its head.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no larger than a matchbox, it sticks to the inside of any cupboard and it makes sure you will never have to wash and iron your clothes again. Just close your cupboard door and the tiny ultrasound device will shake the dust and grime right out of your clothes. And, if your clothes are made from one of NuTech&#8217;s new &#8216;shape memory&#8217; fabrics, they will simply return to their new shape in moments. Too good to be true? Not anymore.<\/p>\n<p>Sony&#8217;s new ClothesMan product has been launched in US and European markets in a joint announcement with NuTech. A myriad of popular brands including Levi Strauss, FCUK and Gap are stocking stores with their latest designs in NuTech&#8217;s smart fabrics to coincide with the launch.<\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: small;\">(Read the full story in the detailed Analysis\/Synthesis section &#8211; for subscribers only)<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><b>Timeline<\/b><br \/>\n<strong>2003: Technological building blocks<\/strong><br \/>\nUltrasound devices are in common use by therapists to aid healing of injuries and by surgeons in performing targeted tissue repair.<br \/>\nShape Memory Alloys (materials created with a semi-permanent \u2018memory\u2019 of their shape) are found in leading-edge applications. They will gradually return to their original shape when distorted (e.g. bumpers on the Mitsubishi Pajero) or will change their shape in response to a change in temperature, or light, or sound (e.g. in medical applications)<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Smart materials emerge<\/strong><br \/>\nNew features are developed in Smart Materials and Smart Fibers. DuPont, a company that has been active in this field since their early successes with Kevlar\u00ae (used in bullet-proof vests) and Lycra\u00ae (who doesn\u2019t use it!), are now developing Smart Materials which include features that can make them nearly invisible, others that can harden on command (e.g. for use as splints by the US Army), and others still can change colour and shape on command.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Fashion-enhanced natural fibres<\/strong><br \/>\nThe first companies start producing fashion-enhanced GM cottons. Scientists have worked out how to put blue colour genes into the cotton plant so that it grows cotton that is already blue instead of white. The idea is to use the cotton to make denim jeans without needing to use toxic indigo dyes. Soon you will be wearing designer genes!<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: e-Fashion lights up<\/strong><br \/>\nThe first OLEP fashion fabric comes onto the market. Organic light emitting polymers (OLEPs) are made up of thin films of organic materials that give off light of various colors when voltage is applied to them. (see also the MindBullet on this topic \u2013 see links below). The first products are shirts and T-shirts that can be any color, any pattern of your choosing.<br \/>\nNew fibers allow control of insulation qualities of fabrics &#8211; use the same shirt for warm weather and cold weather.<br \/>\nNew polyamide fibers with an embedded bacterio-static agent promise to prevent the development of odors in clothes.<br \/>\nAnnounced in time for the year-end retail season: shoes and handbags covered in OLEPs, one product that goes with any outfit &#8211; just download the appropriate software from your mobile phone.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: Memory fibres mass-produced<\/strong><br \/>\nThe first OLEP shirt with full video capability comes onto the market. Bono wears a prototype T-shirt at the Oscars ceremony and wows the audience by showing clips from U2\u2019s latest music video, on his shirt!<br \/>\nOrganic Memory Fibers (OMF) are mass-produced for the first time and become cheap enough to be integrated into medium-price garments. Prices are said to be dropping at the rate of microprocessors \u2013 more than 50% per annum. NuTech licence their open technology widely and give it away freely to selected third-word countries.<br \/>\nLevis become the first to commercialize OMFs. They build a \u2018natural wrinkle\u2019 into their new range of 999 unisex jeans.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: A new fashion and household revolution<\/strong><br \/>\nSony\u2019s announcement of their in-cupboard cleaning devices capitalizes on the growing popularity of shape-memory fabrics. The high-tech nature of these fabrics gives them enormous sex appeal for the young generation of consumers.<br \/>\nIt is believed that sales opportunities for Sony\u2019s ClothesMan products will be limited for the next 2 years but as these new fabrics become commoditized, Sony\u2019s unique CSA (Cleaning Systems Architecture) will ensure a dominance in this market and may threaten manufacturers of traditional household appliances (washing machines, steam irons etc), washing powders and cleaning additives.<br \/>\nSony are playing down the disruptive nature of their new product, saying that they will only target early-adopters and see how the market develops.<br \/>\nCustomers, however, seem to have a different idea. Sony\u2019s products are flying off the shelf causing a massive surge in demand for NuTech fabrics. Designers and clothing manufacturers in the Far East are starting to call it \u201ca fashion revolution\u201d.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1026\" src=\"https:\/\/futureworld.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ScenarioMatrix75.gif\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dream a little.

The fear is that firms could almost unknowingly contravene the confusing anti-spam laws in their traditional customer communications. The conse-quences are serious and the business community is angry. They believe that they could be an easy target for law enforcement agencies, radical lobby groups and class action lawyers.<\/p>\n<p>A quick poll this morning amongst 5 CEOs of leading UK companies confirms the concern. \u201cIt reminds me of Greenpeace in its hey-day&#8221; said one prominent CEO, who did not want to be named. \u201cThe business community is being held hostage by a few hundred underground radicals, and they will continue to thrive\u201d, he said.

Since 2002 mobile phone messaging (sometimes called SMS) has eclipsed email as the most popular electronic messaging service.<\/p>\n<p>Spam has become the bane of individual and corporate users alike. During 2003 spam began to represent more than 50% of all emails sent, and began to emerge as a serious threat on mobile phones. Within the next 3 years it is expected that spam will also represent more than 50% of all SMS traffic. Network operators are caught between loyalties to their business customers (for example, banks and retailers who want to pepper us with ever more advertising) and their end-users.<\/p>\n<p>During the next decade all electronic messaging services will integrate and become vastly more information intensive, with the addition of pictures, charts and videos. The impact of spam, viruses and fraud in these forms of electronic messaging may threaten their very existence and use by all. The world needs some anti-spam action and fast!<\/p>\n<p>In November 2003, America enacted its first laws outlawing spam or unsolicited emails. This followed the UK anti-spam legislation, enacted in October 2003. These initial laws were then rapidly enacted across the world as countries and organizations grappled with the increasing security threats and the spiraling cost of managing email systems to block viruses, spam and junk mail and yet provide employees with unrestricted access to the internet and all its offerings, a legal obligation in terms of the Access to Information legislation found in most English speaking developed countries.<\/p>\n<p>Unsolicited email cost European business 3 billion Euros in lost productivity in 2002 according to the European Commission. Business has begun to question at what point the operational and strategic benefits of electronic messaging pale when compared with the operational cost of maintaining anti-spam, anti-virus and productivity gaining initiatives?<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Spam and regulation explode<\/strong><br \/>\nUK makes spam a criminal offence in an effort to stop the flood of unsolicited email messages being sent to users of the internet. Spammers can now be fined GBP 5000 in a Magistrates court or an unlimited penalty by a jury! Under the new law, companies have to get permission from an individual to send them an email or SMS on their mobile phones! EU and USA rapidly follow suit with similar laws. The US Congress says the new law is a first step in sending a message: \u201cIf you are a spammer, you may end up in the slammer!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Phones 4U is the first company to ban email<\/b><br \/>\nPhones  4U Boss, John Caudwell, sparked a media blitz when he banned all internal email at Phones4U. He claims the ban will save the company GBP 1 million per month. He also claims the messaging format is misused with unnecessary people being copied on nonsense emails. The media attention makes people really think about what email is good for and what it costs within organizations. Of course, it begs the question whether any Generation X\u2019ers will work for a company that does not allow them free networking opportunities in the 2 mediums they know best \u2013 maybe in the only mediums they know, email and SMS!<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Lobbyists drive change<\/strong><br \/>\nMalicious code within spam mails causes more than $50 billion in corporate losses. Global corporations add their voices to the already loud voices of increasingly powerful anti-spam and anti-virus lobbyists all over the world. The figure is estimated to reach $80 billion by 2007. Anti-spam software is expected to reach $3 billion in sales revenues by 2007.<\/p>\n<p><b>Spam decoys proliferate<\/b><br \/>\nThe number of providers offering anti-spam decoy programs grow fast as users demand protection. The challenge remains to balance the effectiveness of anti-spam software with ensuring that legitimate email is not caught in the anti-spam net. Cloudmark, an anti-spam programme using a network based approach, relies on the principles of democracy to counter spam \u2013 if enough users designate a message as spam, all users of Cloudmark automatically have the messages blocked. `<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Spam Commonwealth is born<\/strong><br \/>\n12 English speaking countries join the anti-spam war. New laws ban unrequested email or SMS outright. The burden of proof rests on the company to establish email or SMS consent. Records must be kept for 10 years. The cost of fighting the &#8216;inbox&#8217; war soars to billions of dollars annually in the US alone. Global productivity is under pressure and winning this war will mean significant productivity improvement for embattled companies and countries.<\/p>\n<p><b>First Company charged<\/b><br \/>\nGlobal Mutual Plc, the worlds largest life office following one of the biggest mergers of 2005, becomes the first corporation to be charged with contravening new tough anti-spam laws following a &#8216;class action law-suit&#8217;launched by enraged clients. Clients, who claim to have &#8216;de-registered&#8217; themselves from the Global Mutual\u2019s email lists, are still receiving over 25 marketing messages each over a 6 month period, from various divisions from within Global Mutual. All attempting to entice the customers to purchase investments, new products and new services on offer from the company.<\/p>\n<p><b>Spam now comprises 90% of all email<\/b><br \/>\nIn a dramatic surge in recent months, spam now accounts for more than 90% of all email traffic in the world. Users are not only disgruntled, they are seeking alternatives with increasing urgency. More than 35 billion unwanted email messages swamp the internet every day, according to Microsoft Research. There are now 30 million small businesses in the US alone. If just 1% of these get hold of your email address and send you just 1 email per year, you would have to contend with 657 additional unwanted emails every day \u2013 the equivalent of a spam nuclear war!<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Fortune 500 under spotlight<\/strong><br \/>\nTen new cases against Fortune 500 retailers and leading financial services institutions, including stock brokers, banks and insurers, are launched by the US Attorney General in a concerted effort to bring high profile offenders to book. In a fiery speech before the Annual Telecoms Conference in New York, the Attorney General states that it is essential that big business realizes the practical implications of the new legislation and that the focus is not simply to stop the bedroom hacker from bombarding email users with free mood drugs and cosmetic surgery offers.<\/p>\n<p><b>AI software joins the fight<\/b><br \/>\nBT launches Artificial Intelligence (AI) software to sort all incoming email according to user profiles and signatures \u2013 almost eliminating all spam. The AI software works on PCs and the worlds most widely used communication platform &#8211; the mobile phone.<\/p>\n<p>This software works on the principle that each user defines his or her known &#8216;agent&#8217; that learns usage patterns and senses the user\u2019s broader network. Any incoming mail from a source outside the user\u2019s network and user signature is stopped and the user is afforded the chance to verify the communication before it clogs the user\u2019s inbox and mail server. The new software struggles to achieve take up rates high enough to counter the ongoing explosion in spam.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Lobbyists threaten war<\/strong><br \/>\nAnti-spam lobby groups become more powerful and radical than Greenpeace in its heyday! E-Sanity, the most powerful of these lobby groups, plans a massive attack on business mail servers during the busiest retail season of the year \u2013 the weeks preceding the Christmas shopping rush. Other similarly radical lobbyists threaten to implode (using new seek and destroy software) the world\u2019s key internet servers in a massive, global and co-ordinated attack on unwanted emails. The US and EU governments meet urgently to resolve the threat and tighten existing anti-spam laws hastily.<\/p>\n<p><b>2007 CEO imprisoned<\/b><br \/>\nSir Jim Humphrey-Smythe, CEO of Global Mutual Plc, the worlds largest life assurer, is convicted of the charges brought against him almost 2 years previously and is sentenced to 5 years imprisonment with no option of a fine. The sentence sends shock waves through the corporate world and many CEOs say complying with the new laws governing spam will render many of their business strategies redundant and will set companies back years in their marketing and client service plans.

CD sales drop by more than 10%.<br \/>\nDVD sales explode and now out-sell movies on video tape by 6:1. The digital content on DVDs proves to be an irresistible target for illegal movie downloads from the Internet.<br \/>\nIn September 2003, after more than 100 years in the film business and with 70% of its revenues (and sharply declining profits) still coming from traditional film products, Kodak embarks on a radical strategy to get out of the film camera business. \u201cThe biggest turning point in Kodak\u2019s history!\u201d It\u2019s essentially a shift from being a chemicals business (films, photographic paper and darkroom agents) to becoming an electronics business, focused on consumer, commercial and health markets.

The biggest of these games is Spherix and its virtual world Galande with 4 million registered cyber-citizens followed by Everquest and its fantasy world Norrath. The magic is in the control characters &#8211; or avatars &#8211; which each player creates. This means that characters can gain skills and possessions that can be traded, in the currency of the virtual world or sold through real trading websites like eBay.<\/p>\n<p>Wars are waged, treasure hunted, dragons slayed, sports played and trading done in virtual space. Individuals spending an average of 20 hours a week online engaging in interactive entertainment has had a huge impact on competing leisure activities. Videogame culture is embedded in the lives of people under 30 and growing in adoption for those over 30. The challenge of competition added by the introduction of leagues, tournaments, competitive ranking and large cash prize money is attracting more and more cyber-gamers.<\/p>\n<p>The money-pile is growing as billions of dollars flows through the many tributaries of this complex industry. Everything from game sales, game artefacts, hardware platforms, subscrip-tions, royalties, online time, grassroots community cam-paigns, endorsements, sponsor-ships, merchandising, advertising, online shopping, and more is packaged in this space.<\/p>\n<p>These virtual worlds are being tracked as somewhat of an economic phenomenon which is teaching us a lot about the nature of free and unregulated markets. What you see when people get together where they can produce things and opportunities to exchange them, mostly unfettered, you&#8217;ve got the makings of an economic system.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><strong>2002: America hooked on video games<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>America&#8217;s growing fascination with video games is hard to exaggerate. Last year, U.S. sales of video-game hardware and software rose 43% to hit US$9.4 billion \u2013 which exceeded Hollywood&#8217;s box-office receipts of US$8.35 billion.<\/p>\n<p>According to a 2000 survey from the National Institute on Media and the family 92% of children between the ages of 2 and 17 play video or computer games. 35% of Americans rated video and computer games as \u201cthe most fun entertainment activity.\u201d (TV came in a weak second with just 18% of votes, followed by the Internet, books, and movies.) That same year, U.S. entertainment-software sales topped US$6,2 billion \u2013 nearly three times the gross domestic product of Bermuda.<\/p>\n<p>The early emergence of a new approach to advertising. Not invented by the ad agencies but by the games industry. There is now a new technique called advergaming \u2013 these are Internet games for advertisers. Between 16% and 45% of consumers who receive a game via promotional email actually play it \u2013 for an average of 25 minutes. It gathers information about the player and the preferences and behaviours they display during the game and feeds it back to the company. This is a fundamentally new way of online advertising and far advanced from the banner advertising.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Golden eyeballs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>September 2003 Madden NFL 2004, a videogame pitting real-life NFL teams against one another, grossed US$100 million in 3 weeks and before the next version is out will rake in another US$200 million. The average Madden player will spend conservatively 100 hours mastering the game. That\u2019s 4 million sets of eyeballs times 100 hours. Each of the 13 songs by artists on the Madden soundtrack will burn into the brain of each player more than 100 times, creating more impressions for the artist than they can get on radio or TV.<\/p>\n<p>The games industry is worth some $32 billion once games and hardware are added together.<\/p>\n<p>Electronic Arts generates US$2,5 billion in revenues from its sports, movie and action titles. It has a market capitalisation of around US$13,2 billion and believes it will one day be the biggest entertainment company in the world.<\/p>\n<p>This also makes Electronic Arts the worlds 4th largest software company (after Microsoft, Oracle and SAP)<\/p>\n<p>Videogames is not just chomping up money that used to be spent on entertainment money but also time that would have been spent on music, movies, books etc.<\/p>\n<p>A Fortune magazine article of September 22 2003 showed the changing time (number of hours spent per person per annum) devoted to various forms of entertainment:<\/p>\n<table cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#e0e0f0\">\n<td width=\"250px\"><b>Growing:<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>1997<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>2007<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Internet<\/td>\n<td>25 hrs<\/td>\n<td>225 hrs<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Videogames<\/td>\n<td>40 hrs<\/td>\n<td>110 hrs<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Home Video<\/td>\n<td>50 hrs<\/td>\n<td>100 hrs<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#e0e0f0\">\n<td><b>Declining:<\/b><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Music<\/td>\n<td>260 hrs<\/td>\n<td>150 hrs<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Newspapers<\/td>\n<td>190 hrs<\/td>\n<td>160 hrs<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Magazines<\/td>\n<td>140 hrs<\/td>\n<td>120 hrs<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Books<\/td>\n<td>130 hrs<\/td>\n<td>110 hrs<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>An economic phenomenon is occurring. With increasing number of cyber-gamers collaborating they have started actively trading within the virtual worlds they inhabit and this trade is spilling into the real world with artefacts being traded on sites like eBay.<\/p>\n<p>South Korea is making a big play in the cyber-gaming space, one of their leading companies is NCsoft. The problem NCsoft face is that most games in Japan, America and Europe are played on specially made consoles, such as Nintendo&#8217;s GameBoy or Sony&#8217;s PlayStation2 but Broadband is the solution for South Korea. Online gaming has a huge advantage; no inventory, much more flexibility on development and release cycles and a pay as you go model. What the South Koreans have also learned is that gamers are really keen to meet each other!  This in turn fuels the growth of  MMORG (Massive Multi-player online Roleplaying Games). The South Koreans are really pushing the boundaries of MMORG. Another angle that South Korea is correctly exploiting is providing a diversity of games, appealing to a wide variety of age groups, men and women and different countries and cultures. South Korea may hold the key to the next generation of online games and be a threat to companies like Sony with their Playstation2 and Microsoft with their Xbox.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Internet boosts growth<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Tens of thousands of players or teams of players compete against each other across the Internet on EA (Electronic Arts) Sports Nation<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe ability to create virtual communities online is going to be a much bigger part of the industry going forward\u201d. Robbie Bach, head of  the Microsoft X-Box team.<\/p>\n<p>A virtual world called Everquest attracts 1 million people who pay US$10 per month to spend an average of 20 hours a week in that virtual world.

This is also the biggest inhibitor for those who do not have the access; another example of the \u201cdigital have nots\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft launches a massive online subscription-based network called X-Box-Live.<\/p>\n<p>IBM and software company Butterfly announce the Butterfly Grid \u2013 another internet gaming network.<\/p>\n<p>AOL launches an online gaming league and paid gaming competitions.<\/p>\n<p>The market scope is extending. Increasingly the gaming demographic is no longer solely teenage boys. According to a \u201cState of the Industry\u201d report published by the Interactive Digital Software Association, 72% of frequent computer gamers are 18 or older. In fact, the interactive gamer&#8217;s average age is now 28. And 43% of players are women.<\/p>\n<p>The most avid gamers are young men and middle-aged women, but the goal is to create games that draw every demographic.<\/p>\n<p>China gets onto the cyber-gaming bandwagon, they now formally regard this as a key industry sector and have established the first department of games software in a University. The volume potential is huge; as of 2003 they estimated that already almost half of the country\u2019s 78 million online users play video games on 30 million Internet-connected computers.<\/p>\n<p>The South Korean challenge is shaping up as their games start extending its appeal to the Japanese and American markets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Physical\/Virtual Economy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s play the numbers game. It is really the \u201ceyeball\u201d and \u201cinteraction\u201d potential that is shaking the market. For example SportX, the best selling game of 2004 sold 20 million copies, an average videogame player spends 120 gaming hours per game per year, this means 2,4 billion eyeball hours for SportX this year. Burning each song, each logo, each artist into the brain of each player for 120 hours a year. Compare this to the 2006 smash hit TV series, \u201cWho is doing it\u201d with an estimated 14 million viewers over 14 episodes or 196 million eyeball hours. Where would you bet your money?<\/p>\n<p>The music industry revamps itself and is first of the traditional entertainment sectors to get onboard the videogame and online bandwagon. Major deals have been signed between music companies and videogames companies. An estimated 50% of new albums are launched in joint-ventures with videogames companies.<\/p>\n<p>The US$70 billion movie industry is under pressure. During 2004 an estimated 100 million movies were downloaded illegally and in 2005 this number could increase to 1 billion movies. Cyber-gaming with its increasing realism and quality (often tied into movie themes) is becoming a real alternative to movies.<\/p>\n<p>An interesting real world\/virtual world test case is pending in the courts. A number of virtual newspapers have appeared over the past couple of years, covering the virtual worlds of cyber-gaming. Many of these are deemed to be getting \u201cout of hand\u201d as it pursues its objectives of \u201cmuckraking\u201d about the millions of  virtual inhabitants and their society. Spherix have launched a law-suit to challenge what it calls the \u201cgrossly unfair practices\u201d of The Cyber-eye, one of the worst of these publications. The outcome will have wide ramifications. What next?, law-suits in the Virtual Worlds themselves?<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: The Avatar Economy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fierce competition emerges between music stars, professional athletes and movie stars to be in this year\u2019s top videogames.<\/p>\n<p>A major pre-requisite for movie releases is the associated game. The game tie-ins are beginning to deliver more profits than the movies.<\/p>\n<p>Sports and videogames are coming together. The young sports fanatic wants to watch AND participate. What better way to get close to your hero and his\/her world. Even the music industry has embraced the media with an \u201cInside Victoria Beckham\u201d game.<\/p>\n<p>The AOL gaming league is a smash hit, attracting 50 million players. Cyber-gaming is establishing itself as a serious competitive category and prize money to top tennis and golf tournaments.<\/p>\n<p>Gaming is featured regularly on Saturday TV sports programming.<\/p>\n<p>The diversity of games are representative of the vastly broadened base of games players; all ages, men and women and many countries. People are spending a lot of time in these virtual spaces, whether they are virtual worlds or virtual sports events, and where there are people commerce will happen. Because of the vast number of consumers it is attractive to companies who want to advertise here. Furthermore the games spaces are interactive, so they can learn more about their customers through interaction with them, and can cater better to their needs. This is an even better medium than online with Amazon.com, who already has the highest customer satisfaction ratings in history. Increasingly this looks like an exciting way to transact business.<\/p>\n<p>A formal currency index, linked to the dollar, is established for the currency of Norrath the most mature of the Virtual Worlds.

FORGET IT!"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The European Union debate over Europe&#8217;s pension deficit and the mandatory retirement age has been one of the fiercest in its history. Last night, insults were exchanged across the floor amidst a chaotic scene at the EU Parliament in Brussels, as mem-bers debated the scrapping of the mandatory retirement age.<\/p>\n<p>The bill was narrowly passed. Politicians arguing for abolition cited two key reasons; the first being the inability of the state to adequately provide for retirement in view of dwindling birth rates, the second being that individuals are healthier, live longer and can&#8217;t afford to retire.<\/p>\n<p>Retirement, it is argued, is an outdated concept of the industrial age. In fact they call it Ageism. Today, as long as your mind is working, you can be econo-mically active.<\/p>\n<p>Parliamentary members ran into more trouble as they left the EU headquarters, mobbed by an angry crowd of several hundred people waiting outside. They want accountability for this unmanaged timebomb.<\/p>\n<p>There continues to be conflict between the young and economically active sector and the aging population. Economists believe that managing this dilemma could be a significant contributor to economic success or failure in those countries.<\/p>\n<p>The pace has been forced by the urgent need to meet the deficit in Europe&#8217;s pensions, but the underlying trend is fuelled by both economic necessity at the state individual levels and personal choice.<\/p>\n<p>In any event, many Baby Boomers had already made that lifestyle choice &#8211; work is play and play is work, and neither ever stops&#8230;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><b>Background<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There are many reasons why retirement, as a life stage, may become an anachronism, but there are four streams that define the trend:-<\/p>\n<p>1. Increased healthy life expectancy and a shift in attitude about age<br \/>\n2. The economic impact of ageing population demographics<br \/>\n3. The un-affordability of retirement due to the depletion of state and private pension funds and the lack of personal financial planning by individuals<br \/>\n4. Technology which enhances physical strength and makes manual labour safer and easier plus computer and communications technology which has enhanced brain power and connectivity for continued participation in the workplace<\/p>\n<p><b>Life expectancy and the change in attitudes towards age and retirement<\/b><br \/>\nRetirement is an industrial age idea founded on the fact that at around age 65 men became incapable of operating heavy machinery. Who do you know today who operates heavy machinery? And, note that this sentiment was focused only on men, women did not represent a significant part of the business paradigm in the industrial economy.<br \/>\nThe number of pensioners or retirees who have restarted their economic activity is on the increase. The trend that began as a function of economic necessity is becoming a new value system, supported by enhanced health maintenance. The emerging physical and technological \u2018can-do\u2019 attitude could result in people never retiring, in the traditional sense. They may retire from the companies they worked for, but this does not mean they become economically inactive. Self-employment is on the increase.<br \/>\nThe shift is the cumulative effect of a number of socio-economic drivers, spanning several generations, such as the Baby Boomers and their children. Baby Boomers are educated people \u2013 clever, ambitious, entrepreneurial and achievement oriented. Generally they like to work and to have the freedom to make choices. There is a slow realisation, amongst Baby Boomers, that they have inherited a retirement model from their parents; to many retirement is something that has been foisted upon them.<\/p>\n<p><b>Demographics and economics<\/b><\/p>\n<p>People are living longer. In Europe, the over-60s now account for a quarter of the population. Globally the over-60s account for 10% of the population; this figure is set to increase to 25% in 2050. The fastest section of the world\u2019s population is the elderly.<\/p>\n<p>The birth rate is declining. Apart from the USA, which has the fastest-growing population growth rate of the advanced economies, the falling fertility rate is creating ageing populations in Europe and large parts of Asia. Affordability of retirement becomes a major issue in these countries.<\/p>\n<p>The worker-pensioner dependency ratio (RPD) in Europe is three workers to every pensioner. In 30 years, this will fall to three workers for every two pensioners.<\/p>\n<p>Families are less inclined, or able, to care for their elderly. What will happen to these people?<\/p>\n<p>Business and economies will suffer as they lose their most experienced resources, due to a mandatory retirement age. The cost of investment in education and training will have a higher payback by retaining older workforces. The effect is even greater in developed countries, where there is a higher ratio of skilled older people. In Third World countries, this ratio is reversed: a vast number of the young unemployed are not educated or skilled. Many countries have lost their best skills through emigration.<\/p>\n<p>Continued working would increase economic activity in a growing section of the world\u2019s population. It would provide the availability of experience and skills for an additional 10-15 years and decrease the burden on pension funds.<\/p>\n<p>There is a significant shortfall in pension funds: retirement will become unaffordable. Estimates suggest that only 6% of people have adequate pension provision.

Cover idols include Helen Mirren, Mick Jagger, Sting and Tony Blair. Saga Group Chairman Roger de Haan says \u201cThough many of the UK\u2019s over-50s are poor, this is much less so than in the 1950s. Today they are a much richer community and account for 60% of all personal savings and they control &gt;70% of the nation\u2019s wealth, and they can smell bull**** 100 miles away!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey are active in the most exciting of ways. They want to go to Borneo rather than Bournemouth! They want to try white-water rafting and skydiving. At Saga you can do it without being laughed at by trendy youngsters! In terms of travel and tourism the over-50s represent the most desirable segment \u2013 they have much higher levels of manners, integrity and honesty, and provide very high levels of repeat business.

The US has the fastest population growth rate of the advanced economies and one of the highest fertility rates. This bodes well for their economy<\/p>\n<p>Jim Parkel, president of AARP, (a large American non-profit membership organisation that provides services, information and advocacy for age 50+ and older people), identifies a new phenomenon: the changing nature of work and the need to redefine the words \u2018retirement\u2019 and \u2018work\u2019. In focusing on emerging workplace issues that effect private-sector employees, Parkel is instrumental in addressing pension-related roadblocks that prevent employees from testing forms of phased retirement. He states that many seniors over age 65 do not need a benefit package, but do need other services and products such as \u2018top-notch\u2019 health care and skills-enhancement facilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: 50+ market opportunity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Saga\u2019s data base now includes &gt;10 million over-50s in the UK and is sold for GBP1,5 billion to an international consortium.

This is a sensitive issue, however it is clear that ageing population issues must be addressed from both angles. Just as wrinklies need to stay economically active for longer, there needs to be balancing influx of young workers. Anything else would simply be delaying the inevitable crunch.<\/p>\n<p>The popular press takes up the personal economic consequences of a longer life. Germany\u2019s Stern magazine runs an issue dedicated to personal investments with the headline: \u201cAsk your broker this question: What will my lifestyle be like should I live to 100? Your cash flow may work until 90, but consider what another 10 or 20 years of healthy life will do for your personal finances!\u201d Within two months similar stories appear world-wide and cause an over-50s investment paranoia.

As companies attempt to keep pace with competitors, they increasingly tap into the older, qualified, but often retired, Baby Boomer generation.

Switching was a major personal impact as you had to have a new telephone number. Laws and regulations are changing everywhere in favour of the consumer \u2013 you will now be able to switch between networks while keeping your own phone number (including the mobile service providers prefix! This will clearly improve competitive conditions and encourage users to swop around \u2013 a phenomenon that is setting the open market cats amongst the network operator and service provider pigeons!<\/p>\n<p><b>Timeline<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>2000: UK legislation leads the way<\/strong><br \/>\nNew legislation switches ownership of mobile phone numbers to customers rather than service providers. With number portability, a customer can switch mobile service providers at will. Two million users switched in the first year! Big problem is consumer awareness \u2013 for obvious reasons, the mobile networks simply don\u2019t advertise it! It\u2019s up to consumers themselves to become aware.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2001: Regulators pile in<\/strong><br \/>\nFearing that network operators are resisting the move to number portability, UK regulator, OFTEL, sets a new standards that will force network operators to effect switch times in 5 days (rather than the previous average of more than 25 days) by September 2001. Sofware developer, Softwright, is given the contract to develop this Mobile Number Portability (MNP) system to be implemented between competing networks<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: Virgin gets on board \u2013 US lags<\/strong><br \/>\nVirgin Mobile advertises \u201cWe transfer your mobile number to Virgin in just 5 days!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the USA, number portability is still being reviewed. At this stage just 2.7% of mobile customers switch supplier every month.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: US begins to get serious<\/strong><br \/>\nDuring June-October US service providers start a mad scramble to sign up customers into new 2-year contracts with superb deals, before the new regulations come into place. Providers base their strategies largely on consumer ignorance of the impending new regulations. This year just 35 million subscribers switch networks.<\/p>\n<p>On 24 November new US federal regulations come into force that, for the first time, allow users to keep their mobile phone numbers when they switch service providers. It is expected that the real impact of this new regulation will only be felt when these &#8216;sweetener contracts&#8217; expire at the end of 2005.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Mobile bandwidth prices plummet<\/strong><br \/>\nMany mobile networks are now run on the same packet-switched architecture as the Internet. The backbone of all mobile networks are shared with other network capacity. It is only the last few hundred metres of the mobile network that is in fact mobile.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile bandwidth is becoming so plentiful that new brokers are selling it like a commodity \u2013 but with a very service-oriented front-end to the customer. Brokers are able to offer customers the best deal from among the network operators \u2013 they use their buying power (of millions of subscribers) to switch millions of users from one network to another based on total cost of service and service quality.<\/p>\n<p>The network operators are in uproar and look for legislation to prevent them from an eternal price war. They say the industry has become &#8220;impossible to predict and plan for&#8221;. They have lost not only the interface to the consumer but are now being held hostage as brokers are seen to buy only from the lowest bidder. Brokers claim &#8220;All networks can provide similarly excellent levels of service today &#8211; some are just more inefficient than others. We help consumers weed out this inefficiency!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Profits shift from Vodafone to Virgin<\/strong><br \/>\nVirgin, the biggest European mobile service broker, reports massive profits even as network operators dip into the red.

A new cure for malaria was first on the agenda, as the Anglo Research Division confirmed its organic plant derivative had proved successful in clinical trials.<\/p>\n<p>The Anglo subsidiary Mondi Ventures becomes one of the first major resource conglo-merates to diversify into BioPharming, turning some of its land previously reserved for forests into bio-factories, by planting modified trees, sugar-cane, bananas and corn.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe had a choice \u2013 continue to grow forests for the raw material of paper production, or use the land and its biological potential to grow higher-value products, such as plastics, packaging, food, drugs and vaccines,\u201d said an Anglo spokesperson. \u201cWhen <i>you<\/i> look around you and see forests and fields, <i>we<\/i> see biological factories that could produce almost anything in the future. Our banana plantations in Africa are delivering a cure for one of the world&#8217;s most prevalent diseases, whilst in Russia and Asia we are growing the raw materials to produce bio-plastics.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anglo also announced that Mondi&#8217;s automotive industry clients plan to make more than 30% of their components from organic materials within the next year.<\/p>\n<p>To look at a forest and see a factory would have been unthinkable just a decade ago. The advances announced by Anglo show how the world can benefit from the responsible genetic manipulation of plants, to create products for the future. Mondi Ventures&#8217; new advertising campaign stresses the &#8216;natural&#8217; way \u2013 <i>&#8216;Spend a weekend in our factory!&#8217;<\/i> The movie shows a family barbecue in a lush, green Asian forest.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><strong>1998: Clinical trials with \u2018grown vaccines\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Transgenic plants are developed that hold the potential of producing important medicines and vaccines. A human gene has been added to corn, causing it to secrete human antibodies designed to stick to and kill tumour cells. In the fall of 1997, these antibodies entered clinical trials on cancer patients.<\/p>\n<p>Genetically-altered soybeans are developed, which produce human antibodies against herpes simplex virus II. The hope is to produce an anti-herpes drug that can be added to contraceptives.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1999: Third World GM crop boom<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>GM crops, such as cotton and maize, help tens of thousands of Third World farmers produce greater yields, in marginally suitable areas. These produce less pesticide residues, resulting in cleaner, safer local water supplies. The benefits are improved health and faster economic development.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2000: New recycling laws<skip><\/skip><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In April, Japan passes new laws which add the costs of recycling plastics to the base price. It gives a massive competitive advantage to recyclable products.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2001: Cargill Dow builds corn plastics plant<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Commodities giants, Cargill Inc and Dow Chemical Co, build the world&#8217;s first large-scale facility for manufacturing plastics from corn, through JV Cargill Dow Polymers. The plant is expected to consume 14 million bushels of corn per year. The process  produces pellets of polymer resin, &#8216;polylactide&#8217; (PLA), by fermenting the sugar in corn syrup into lactic acid, then turning it into spin fibers. The PLA is sold under the name &#8216;NatureWorks PLA&#8217;. It is used to manufacture a wide range of bio-degradable consumer goods from food packaging and furnishings, to cups, automotive components, textiles and bedding, mattresses, pillows and rugs.<\/p>\n<p>Since the base material of bio-plastic is a plant, (which absorbs carbon dioxide from the air as it grows), the production process contributes to the prevention of global warming \u2013 unlike conventional petroleum-based plastics. Bio-plastics can be produced with bio-degradable properties that allow them to be broken down into water and carbon dioxide by micro-organisms in the ground, thus helping to solve waste disposal problems. As such, bio-plastics can make a significant contribution to reducing environmental impact.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: GM trees to reduce lignin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first trees are modified to reduce their lignin content by up to 50%. Lignin is a component of plant cell walls and is one of the major waste products in pulp and paper mills. It typically needs to be extracted using extremely toxic chemicals. The lignin-reduced GM trees will lower the cost of paper production, by reducing the amount of chemicals used, and make the process more environmentally-friendly. The plan is to turn the remaining 50% lignin into a bio-degradable plastic within the next few years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Toyota and Cargill Dow embrace bio-plastics<skip><\/skip><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In May, Toyota launches the Raum passenger vehicle using bio-plastic components to improve durability, heat resistance and environmental impact. Toyota announces construction of a new plant to produce bio-plastics made from renewable resources, such as sugar-cane. The facility is designed to produce 1,000 tons of bio-plastics a year. Toyota also announces that it plans to adapt the technology to a wide range of plastic products that pervade peoples&#8217; daily lives outside the automotive field.<\/p>\n<p>Cargill Dow launches a bio-plastic container &#8211; the latest technological development in the &#8216;green&#8217; packaging revolution. The new package looks like plastic, but is made from corn, and bio-degrades completely after disposal. Wild Oats Inc is the first grocery chain in the United States to introduce the packaging. Its ranges of salads, desserts and deli products receive an extremely positive response in Japan and Europe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Banana genome sequenced<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bananas and plantain are the world&#8217;s most-eaten fruit and the staple starch source in the diet for millions of people in the developing world. They are also one of the most highly-sprayed crops.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Edible vaccines produced in transgenic plants<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>British scientists develop a banana with a malaria vaccine built into its genetic structure. The bananas are engineered to be pink instead of yellow, to differentiate the vaccine product from the pure fruit.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at the University of California develops a transgenic potato plant that carries the vaccine against cholera. The potatoes supply non-toxic cholera toxin B (CTB), a harmless protein that sparks an immune response to the disease. Third World countries, (where more than a million people die each year from such preventable diseases), stand to benefit from this cheap, convenient source of disease prevention, which is estimated to be available commercially within three years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: New health-enhanced crops<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Vegetables with higher vitamin E content are expected to help fight heart disease. An improved strain of rice, with enhanced levels of vitamin A and iron, will help battle nutritional deficiencies in many peoples&#8217; diets.<\/p>\n<p>A host of new products from GM plants is announced: bio-inks used in newspapers, new fuels and lubricants, cosmetics, animal feeds, foodstuffs, dyes and adhesives.<\/p>\n<p>Mondi Ventures establishes its first major &#8216;Factory Plantations&#8217; in Russia, Africa and South-East Asia.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Commercial \u2018BioPharming\u2019 emerges&gt;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Despite controversy over possible safety issues, the combination of farming, bio-technology and pharmaceuticals appears to produce better health, a cleaner, safer environment and vastly increased production.<\/p>\n<p>The use of transgenic plants to produce drugs proves cheaper than obtaining them through traditional means. A transgenic tobacco plant, for example, is developed which manufactures the enzyme, <i>glucocerebrosidase<\/i> in its leaves. Obtaining this enzyme by conventional methods is very expensive. People who suffer from Gaucher&#8217;s disease, (and who cannot make this crucial enzyme in their bodies), currently pay up to US$160,000 per year to obtain it. Another example is an anti-clotting agent used in coronary-bypass operations: using transgenic plants this can be produced at US$1-2 per gram, compared with around US$150 by bio-reactor production. Besides turning out drugs cheaply, these technologies are easy and inexpensive to scale up.<\/p>\n<p>Allergies become a major target for BioPharming. Lactose and wheat intolerance could become a thing of the past, if allergens in milk and wheat products are eliminated or greatly reduced.<\/p>\n<p>A new cure for certain types of cancer is announced: Taxol, a secondary plant product derived from the bark and needles of genetically-modified Pacific Yew trees.<\/p>\n<p>A joint venture between Mondi Ventures and Canada&#8217;s Nexia Biotechnologies Inc, instals the first herds of goats underneath the forest canopies to produce BioSteel\u00ae. This product is based on recombinant spider silk proteins and is produced in the milk of transgenic goats. Spider silk has long been admired by material scientists for its unique combination of high-performance properties including toughness, strength, lightness and flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>Anglo American encourages small farmers to engage in BioSteel\u00ae production, by using the company&#8217;s land and regional milk processing facilities in return for a small share of any profits made.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: Strategic repositioning for Anglo<skip><\/skip><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Anglo American, through its subsidiary, Mondi Ventures, becomes one of the first major resource conglomerates to diversify into BioPharming, turning some of its forests into bio-factories powered by trees, sugar-cane and corn.

It provides information and advice about the food choices you make, before you make them, and alerts you of foods inappropriate for your blood type or weight.<\/p>\n<p><i>ChippIE<\/i> fits your lifestyle and works via your cell phone, wristwatch, spectacles or what-ever other devices you choose. The best yet is that it can be installed on any other chip implant technology that you already have in use.<\/p>\n<p>It is personal and private, and it is your choice. And as far as the food industry and the insurance companies are con-cerned, it puts the responsibility for what you eat back where it belongs &#8211; in the consumer&#8217;s hands.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><b>Timeline<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>1998: Tobacco companies respond to litigation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The USA&#8217;s four major tobacco companies reach an unprecedented $246 billion legal settlement with state governments, to help cover costs of smoking-related illnesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: Fast-food industry faces litigation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Jazlyn Bradley, a 19-year old Bronx teenager weighing 268lbs, sues McDonalds for making her fat.

On the same day, an appeals court in Florida overturns a $145 billion compensation award granted by a lower court, to a group of smokers suing America&#8217;s five biggest tobacco companies.<\/p>\n<p>In June, more than 100 US lawyers and consumer advocates pledge a broad series of lawsuits against fast-food chains, food manufacturers and even school boards that sell high-calorie soft drinks without offering healthier choices. The goal is not to put fast food out of business, but to get the industry to offer healthier choices and give the consumer more product information. 65% of adults and 13% of children in America are either overweight or obese.<\/p>\n<p>In October, the &#8216;genome on a chip&#8217; arrives. With pieces of all 30,000 or so, known human genes, the new integrated gene chip, or &#8216;microarray&#8217;, allows scientists to scan all genes in a human tissue sample at once to determine which genes are active (turned on) in a diseased organ, compared with those active in a healthy organ. Pharmaceutical companies will use them to predict drug effects. The new &#8216;whole-genome&#8217; chips lower costs and increase the speed of testing, to achieve the genomics equivalent of Moore&#8217;s Law.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Healthy fast-food demanded<skip><\/skip><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sales at fast-food chains such as McDonald&#8217;s and Burger King decline further, despite massive changes in products and marketing strategies to reflect the need for more healthy food alternatives. &#8216;Fast casual&#8217; food, comprising gourmet sandwich, salad and soup chains, increase their sales. Fast casual offers healthier menus, higher-quality, fresher, more varied food and a more tempting ambience than plastic chairs and garish lighting. With sales of $5 billion a year, fast-casual is tiny compared with the $153 billion fast-food market, but it is growing by 30% a year.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Under-skin chip production begins<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Intel teams up with sensor specialists, Cyberkinetics, to develop &#8216;under-skin&#8217; chips, entering a market previously dominated by small venture capital firms.

Sean Connery, the imposing, but ageing, figure on the podium, or Sean Connery, the electronic avatar, with the characteristic gravelly voice and a youthful spring in his step? It seems nobody in the Academy could decide, as the judges voted on a joint award last night at the 2010 Oscar Awards ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>Connery&#8217;s having to share the Oscar follows the outrageous box office success of the remake of Goldfinger, this time starring his avatar double. Goldfinger was originally released in 1964, and is widely regarded as the most successful of the Connery-era Bond movies. No one could have imagined this ironic out-come when Connery sold off his avatar rights five years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Trouble between the \u2018two\u2019 Connerys broke out during the acceptance speech, as a public vocal exchange erupted over credits for the performance. The man behind the avatar&#8217;s success is Sam Darke, the young, unknown \u2018virtual acting\u2019 graduate from the Los Angeles Institute of Electronic Arts, who works with the avatar to help develop the richness of interpretation. It is indicative of the changes swee-ping through the industry that Darke, although unknown as an actor, had earlier won an Oscar for Best Electronic Direction in a motion picture.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, AvCast.com, the largest global casting agency matching avatars and people, announced its successful public offering. The move reflects the growing demand for unique avatar personalities to deliver a more natural customer interface in a wide range of industries such as games, movies, news reading and continuity announcement, hospitality, travel, healthcare and customer service.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><b>Background<\/b><\/p>\n<p>As used in this MindBullet, avatars are virtual representations of human beings. The word &#8216;avatar&#8217; has its origin in Sanskrit, meaning the earthly image of a god. The book Bhagavad Gita describes the god Krishna&#8217;s earthly avatar as a &#8216;dramatic purple being&#8217;, when he is represented in the &#8216;real&#8217; world.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the word is used mainly to describe an, often imaginary, image of a human being used in virtual worlds on the Internet. Increasingly, the concept is being applied to areas such as movies. Plans are afoot to make a new movie starring Clark Gable \u2013 using an electronic avatar of the long-dead actor. The process is known as photogrametry.<\/p>\n<p>Once created, avatars can be programmed to behave much like the original actor or actress. Speech can be artificially created, or driven by the live speech of a \u2018teacher\u2019 or \u2018director\u2019. Movements can be similarly programmed and directed, to add authenticity to the way a person walks and holds themself.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key technological challenges is to create fully-digital models of the human figure and face, so that the software itself can figure out the mechanics of a character&#8217;s movement, rather than following the lead of motion-capture data.<\/p>\n<p>Progress in virtual characters is likely to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Obviously, the original can be endlessly changed or improved. The temptations will be endless.<\/p>\n<p><b>Timeline<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>1984: Max Headroom UK<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Britain\u2019s Channel Four television station decides to use a fake, computer-generated host for a new music video show. It invents the character of Max Headroom, a wise-cracking news anchor man.

Later that year, Ananova.com is sold to mobile phone operator, Orange.<\/p>\n<p>A world record is set when 260,000 human avatars are produced in London&#8217;s Millennium Dome, by UK-based Televirtual and its partner scan company, AvatarMe. The avatars are produced via full-body scanning booths and are able to walk, run and display a variety of physical skills through imported motion capture data. Televirtual also works with another UK company, DigiMask, which uses photogrametry procedures to make avatars. DigiMask only produces heads, but heads which can be retrieved from a server-based system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: Lord of Special Effects and S1mOne<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The movie, &#8216;The Lord of The Rings &#8211; The Two Towers&#8217; is released.

Each scene with Golum is shot three times: once with Serkis on location, once without him, and once in a studio with Serkis wearing a motion-capture suit. The computer-generated Orcs in the film are autonous and smart. They don&#8217;t bump into one another. They recognize good characters from bad. To build intelligent animations, the technicians start with the physics-level biomechanics of muscle and bone<\/p>\n<p>This year, the film &#8216;S1mOne&#8217; is released, founded on the premise that a virtual actress can look realistic enough to fool even her co-stars. Despite the hype, S1mOne (the name is a play on the words Sim One), is played by live-action actress Rachel Roberts, with the assistance of magnificent special effects.

The gap between &#8216;reality&#8217; and &#8216;perceived reality&#8217; widens.<\/p>\n<p>Avatar animation software becomes so sophisticated that it becomes almost impossible to tell the difference between high-budget avatars and the real individual. Increasingly, human assistance is sought to create unpredictable and life-like qualities to avatars. The best of these \u2018avatar directors\u2019, who direct the avatars\u2019 performance and raise it from wooden to dramatic, begin to be stars in their own right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Paparazzi for avatars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Paparazzi hunt down the \u2018stars behind the avatars\u2019.

The effect on the cosmetic surgery industry is marked: one in three people booking in for a \u2018nip and a tuck\u2019 is now over 60 years old. In their search for health, fitness and well-being, these people are creating a booming market.<\/p>\n<p>South Africa&#8217;s success has been in harnessing its learned competencies with its natural tourism resources and the latest developments in technology.<\/p>\n<p>The result is a thriving niche in one of the fastest growing markets in the world. As Hollywood is to the movie industry and Singapore is to shipping, South Africa has become a natural hub for tourism and health \u2013 two of the world&#8217;s fastest-growing industries. <\/p>\n<p>South Africa has the happy combination of good climate, wildlife and beautiful scenery. Its currency rates are attractive to Europeans and Americans alike, and its plastic surgeons are some of the most skilled in the world. <\/p>\n<p>Having become a world leader in cosmetic surgery with the younger generation, South Africa&#8217;s surgeons are evolving their skills for the older, \u2018quality of life\u2019 market.

It carries none of the risks associated with bacterial and viral infections for donor-blood transfusions, and no allergic or immune reactions.<\/p>\n<p>Cosmetic surgery is still the province of the young and early middle-aged. Elderly skin &#8211; thinner, tauter and more inclined to infection &#8211; is largely beyond the bounds of cosmetic surgery for the 60+ years age group. Reduced skin elasticity, the increase of infection and the greater time needed for healing, make plastic surgery for the elderly a risky business. As such, it is provided only on medical grounds. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2001: South Africa&#8217;s &#8216;surgical safari&#8217; niche><skip><\/skip><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>South Africa creates a niche by combining cosmetic surgery with luxury holidays. Due to the cheap Rand, natural tourist facilities and skilled surgeons, South Africa quickly becomes a popular destination for medical tourism for Europeans.<\/p>\n<p>The demand for cosmetic surgery in the USA has risen by 304% over the last five years. In the last year alone, there is a 48% rise in demand for cosmetic surgery in the USA. The surge in the market illustrates the willingness of Americans to incorporate plastic surgery to their health and beauty regimes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: Cosmetic surgery a $20 billion business<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>7.5 million Americans have cosmetic plastic surgery this year: 6.1 million of them women. 25% of these people are aged between 51-64 years. Statistics show that cosmetic plastic surgery has moved beyond the notion of being a privilege for the rich and famous. The top five cosmetic surgical procedures in the US are liposuction, breast augmentation, eyelid surgery, rhinoplasty and breast reduction. Botox injections, that freeze the facial muscles that cause wrinkles, become the most popular procedure. Cosmetic dentistry also booms.<\/p>\n<p>So does South Africa&#8217;s tourism: 1.8 million overseas visitors to the country this year &#8211; a 20% increase from 2001.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Technology expands the market><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Rapid developments in the field of cosmetic surgery overcome previous complications in post-surgical recovery. Modern<br \/>\nsurgical techniques and the use of platelet gels accelerate the healing process in elderly patients, making cosmetic surgery a viable procedure for the 60+ years age group. Platelet gel,(produced by using a small amount of the patient&#8217;s own blood), helps heal by releasing growth factors that set off a cascade of complex events in wound healing. It contains high levels of two growth factors: one, which assists the early stage of wound healing; the other which speeds the development of new blood cells. In cosmetic surgery, its use helps to decrease the amount of bruising traditionally associated with procedures, thus making surgery a faster process.<\/p>\n<p>Cosmetic surgery becomes more affordable. Drooping prices have helped cosmetic surgery to move into the mainstream. More than 70% of those who come under the knife now earn less than $50,000 a year. Alan Matarasso, one of America&#8217;s leading plastic surgeons, says: \u201cTen years ago you could reconstruct a woman&#8217;s breasts for $12,000 \u2014 now it can be done for $600.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Overseas tourists to South Africa increase by a further 10%, helped by strong marketing campaigns. The country is seen as neutral and safe. The UK, USA and Germany account for 48% of South Africa&#8217;s overseas tourists &#8211; all countries in which cosmetic surgery has flourished. Reports suggest more than 20 patients a month arrive through each of the top cosmetic surgery consultancies: if only five of these consultancies treat 100 patients at R30,000 a go, the economy strengthens. In terms of the future, a lot will depend on currency exchange rates and how competitive SA&#8217;s prices are going to be. The country&#8217;s medical quality is high &#8211; a fact that becomes more and more recognized as people return to their countries of origin and spread the word.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Longer lives mean bigger markets<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The average life expectancy for a newborn child in the USA is around 77 years. One in six people in developed countries is now over 65 years. The number of people in the world over 65 years grows by nine million this year. 580 million people in the world are now over 60 years old and fully expecting to live another 20-30 years. They have money, and they want to look and feel good.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Quality of life drives health market<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Well-being&#8217; is a key market driver, based on whole treatment systems that cover beauty, exercise and diet. Natural cures and being fit are embedded in this approach. Modern beauty is about health, self-esteem and empowerment. Within this, cosmetic surgery is no longer seen as a matter of vanity. It has become an intrinsic method of pushing back the barriers of age. <\/p>\n<p>Greying baby boomers request &#8216;bionic shoulders&#8217; and cartilage cell knee transplants, rather than giving up their favorite sport when their bodies wear out. In this age group, fitness is extremely important. But where will they stop? Where America leads the world will follow, and the US grooming market is currently worth around $3.5 billion. Having started cosmetic surgery, baby boomers will want to continue to push back the barriers of ageing. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Boom in surgery for men<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cosmetic surgery for men is becoming increasingly popular. UK clinics see a boom this year in the number of men seeking anti-ageing counselling, dermal fillers and skincare. In the US, a full &#8216;Baywatch&#8217; physique costs around $25,000, including silicone implants that give you bulging pecs, without the need for the gym. Transform, the UK&#8217;s largest chain of cosmetic surgery clinics, estimates that 15% of all cosmetic procedures in Britain are now carried out on men. This figure rises to 20% for Botox injections and eye-bag removal. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Well-being drives tourist market<skip><\/skip><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is a shift in tourism: &#8216;well-being&#8217; is a key driver in the competitive travel market. In a quest to fill beds and theatres, private hospitals evolve into travel destinations: while you are having your body upgraded, your family holidays in the adjoining health spa. Tour operators provide nurses and doctors for post-operative treatment, whilst guiding tours. <\/p>\n<p>Health cruises become popular, with surgical staff utilizing the newest medical techniques.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: South Africa a world-class hub><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The country&#8217;s position in medical tourism is recognized globally. Study and educational tours, (with vetinerary surgeons studying big game wildlife, for instance), have now been added to South Africa&#8217;s growing number of health\/education and leisure attractions. Health cruises prove popular, enhancing global perception of the country&#8217;s tourist attractions.<\/p>\n<p>A number of spin-offs augment the pursuit of well-being:-<br \/>\n&#8211; television gameshows appear where peoples&#8217; ages are guessed after they have had cosmetic surgery.<br \/>\n&#8211; &#8216;ageing&#8217; counseling prospers, along with support groups to help people deal with the unplanned effects of cosmetic surgery.<br \/>\n&#8211; the South African insurance market benefits, due to policy sales covering the &#8216;unplanned outcomes&#8217; of cosmetic surgery. <\/p>\n<p><strong>2009: Gene therapy techniques enhance surgery><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whilst the &#8216;natural&#8217; well-being approach remains popular, anti-ageing gene therapy techniques gain ground. Bionics &#8211;<br \/>\nbone-prosthesis systems and implantable, high technology neurostimulation devices &#8211; are used to strengthen elderly physiques and fragile bones.

Surplus electricity produced by smallholdings and larger properties is sold back to the national grid. Within two years, energy for hospitals, schools and streets is expected to be provided by bacterial fuel.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, the utilities have dwindled to being distributors of excess power, relying on factories and other business customers for their survival.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><b>Timeline<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>1960s: NASA puts fuel cells to practical use<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While the concept of fuel cells has been around for more than a hundred years, the first practical fuel cells were developed for the United States space program in the 1960s. The space program required an efficient, reliable and compact energy source for the Gemini and Apollo spacecraft, and the fuel cell was a good fit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2000: Fuel cells light Times Square<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Durst Organization announces that fuel cells have begun providing supplemental power at its new signature building at 4 Times Square in New York City, the Cond\u00e9 Nast Building. The two truck-sized fuel cells are tucked away on an unoccupied floor of the building. Together they generate 400 kilowatts of electricity, which normally will provide a portion of the building&#8217;s general power requirements. However, if there is a utility blackout, the systems are capable of operating independent of the utility grid to maintain power to critical mechanical components and external landmark signage on the facade of the building. The signs will be bright even in a blackout, with environmentally friendly, off-grid power.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: Sugar and slugs power robot fuel cells<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Scientists at the Intelligent Autonomous Systems Laboratory (IAS) at the University of West of England develop a bacterial fuel cell that runs entirely on sugar. The cell feeds a robot called &#8216;Ecobot&#8217; that follows light around a room and must learn to collect its own energy supply. Ecobot&#8217;s design is based on a similar robot &#8216;trained&#8217; to gather slugs to feed the biodigestor powering its energy system. The microbial fuel cell uses <i>E.coli<\/i> bacteria that feeds off sugar. As the bacteria break down their food, electrons are produced and captured to power two motors. The motors move the robot towards light sources in burst motions.<\/p>\n<p>Energy costs from utilities continue to increase. Pilot projects in the USA have private homeowners installing private generators and fuel cells to ensure continuity of supply. They are the first to sell excess current generated back into the grid, using two meters and paying only the net amount consumed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Huge advances in alternative energy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The first bacterial fuel cell is developed: in a Pentagon-supported project, scientists Swades Chaudhuri and Derek Lovely of the University of Massachusetts, announce they have recovered a tiny bacterium from sediment. This primitive microbial fuel cell can convert simple sugars into electricity with 81% efficiency. Unlike previous attempts to manufacture fuel cell batteries, their design does not require unstable intermediaries to shuttle electrons, and holds promise for producing energy from sugar-containing waste materials. The fuel cell prototype is enough to power a tiny lamp. This conversion has a higher efficiency than any previously known organism. Harmless carbon dioxide gas is produced as a by-product.<\/p>\n<p>Manufacturing adopts fuel cells: EnBW installs a fuel cell at the Michelin Plant in Karlsruhe. The fuel cell has the electrical capacity of 250 kW and a thermal capacity of 180 kW. It produces steam at 200\u00b0C used for the vulcanization of tyres.<\/p>\n<p>In August, the USA suffers the worst power blackout in history. Shares in alternative energy companies soar as much of the North East staggers back. The blackout highlights our dependency on conventional grid power and adds weight to the urgency to find alternative off-grid sources.<\/p>\n<p>In October, UK power chiefs warn Government of widespread blackouts within four years. The industry is divided on which way to handle the looming power crisis. ScottishPower and Powergen want Government to provide incentives for generating companies to keep operating their least efficient plants. French-owned EDF is against a return to capacity payments, which were scrapped in 2001.<\/p>\n<p>Also in October, hydrogen fuels cells advance, when the Alternate Energy Corporation (AEC) announces the results of its highly anticipated hydrogen &#8216;purity testing&#8217;. The hydrogen program achieves the purity goal ahead of schedule. The result pave the way for immediate fuel cell testing. AEC&#8217;s low-cost hydrogen production system will help enable residential and commercial customers generate their own electricity off-grid, at on-grid competitive prices. Affordable hydrogen and fuel cell systems are the only necessary components to grid-free power that compares in price and quality to grid power. Just as the cellphone industry has freed residential and business telephone users from copper wires run to their homes, AEC is working to free these same customers from utility power.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: More winter power blackouts<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is a growing sense of urgency to find viable alternative energy sources, as much of the UK and USA suffers week-long powercuts through the coldest part of the winter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Deregulation gathers pace<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The previous winter&#8217;s power cuts have been a powerful catalyst to get governments worldwide to deregulate the provision and distribution of electricity. This opens the door to massive private sector initiatives, using the latest technology.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: Bacterial fuel cells enter mass production<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bacterial fuel cells become more efficient and offer a viable economic alternative for home users.<\/p>\n<p>There are emerging future trends: not least towards self-sufficiency, environmental sensitivity and more fractal organisations. Bacterial fuel cell production is a prime example of a fractal model: fuel cells can be manufactured in small units and power generation can be distributed throughout the grid, providing improved stability and self-sufficiency. Excess energy produced can be redistributed into the grid.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2011: Compost generator sales soar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sales of domestic compost makers, which produce electricity through organic waste, hit record levels: they are one of the decade&#8217;s most successful products. Fuel cell units are now used by 50% of US households. 35% of households in the developed world have a compost generator in the back yard. The dream of &#8216;free&#8217; electricity for the average home user becomes a reality.<\/p>\n<p>There is a strong uptake in bacterial fuel cell technology in developing countries. Manufacturing is rapidly moving from South-East Asia to East Asia, particularly mainland China. Fuel cell technology is attractive in places where power grids are less reliable and blackouts common.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2014: Bacterial fuel cell farms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fuel cell farms thrive as power is sold to urban communities. Surplus electricity produced by smallholdings and larger properties is sold back to the national grid.<\/p>\n<p>The waste disposal industry equally blossoms. The bacteria <i>Rhodoferax Ferrireducens<\/i> is found in iron-rich soil and is partial to a variety of sugars including xylose, a common waste product in sectors such as paper manufacturing. The bacteria has the potential to remove every last scrap of waste. It is the most efficient effluent treatment by far, completely oxidizing sugar to carbon dioxide and water.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2016: Big power companies fight for survival<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Within two years, energy for hospitals, schools and streets is expected to be provided by bacterial fuel cells.

The Russian Institute of Geology estimates that six billion barrels of oil might be located within another disputed island chain in the South China Sea. With a conservative estimate of 105 billion barrels located in the whole region, the Energy Information Administration calculates a daily production rate of 1.4-1.9 million barrels of crude oil.

And that structure &#8211; a &#8220;double helix&#8221; that can &#8220;unzip&#8221; to make copies of itself &#8211; confirmed suspicions that DNA carries life&#8217;s hereditary information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1986: Plan to unlock Human Genome<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The plan for the project to unlock the Human Genome is announced.

Almost all Iceland\u2019s 270,000 residents descend from one single progenitor group and can trace their family back 1,000 years to the Vikings \u2013 which makes them a unique study group.

Hundreds of scientists from six countries have worked together to achieve this goal.<\/p>\n<p>The human genome is unlocked, but amidst the excitement, legal arguments are raging. Technical problems, commercial restrictions and political wrangling impede progress.<\/p>\n<p>Scientists at King\u2019s College, London and the University of Edinburgh donate tissue to a new embryonic stem cell university research bank. Their hope is that it will be government-funded. This is a milestone for medical researchers. The UK offers a more favorable climate for stem cell research than most countries. Researchers from outside the UK offer their cell lines to the bank. Companies can buy the cell lines at commercial rates; academics can purchase them at nominal rates.<\/p>\n<p>In July, the UK Biobank is launched with \u00a345 million funding. Half a million people in Britain, picked at random, will be asked to have a provide information on lifestyle, and have a blood test to donate their DNA.

For $50 these businesses will keep your DNA profile for 15 years. They market this service on the basis of paternity and will claims, and social security fraud.<\/p>\n<p>There is public unease: is our DNA safe? What will the research companies do with it? People wonder if they may need their DNA profile. What happens if it is stolen? Cells banked for one purpose, such as medical diagnosis, are shared with or sold to other users for research or profit. Whilst most people are in principle keen to aid research, they also want to benefit personally, lest a body part fails and needs replacing. And, if there is money to be made, they want their share.

RFID tags are placed upon every item in a warehouse or retail store and respond instantly to interrogation by a radio transmitter. Inventory management and stocktaking are no longer labor-intensive tasks. Current RFID tags are not yet cheap enough to go unnoticed by the accounts department, nor so inconspicuous as to go unseen by the customer.<\/p>\n<p>A standard operating system emerges for Smart Dust sensor network, known as <i>TinyOS<\/i>. Developed by scientists at Berkeley, this open-source operating system works on fewer than 8kb of memory, and demonstrates great flexibility.<\/p>\n<p><i>TinyOS<\/i> is used by West Coast-based Crossbow Technology Inc, to control the sensor networks that track car parts.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2004: Micro motes monitor temperatures<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Micro motes are used by York International Group, a world leading ventilation management company, to monitor temperatures in the air-conditioning systems of hundreds of commercial clients.

Through the theatres and halls there is not a single incandescent light bulb or fluorescent tube to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, like huge signs, the walls and ceilings emit a continuous white light, that diffuses in a subtle glow.<\/p>\n<p>The lights are in the walls! The ceiling is the light! And it\u2019s all running at a fraction of the normal cost. South Bank\u2019s state of the art lighting is due to organic light emitting polymer technology &#8211; sheets of glowing plastics that emit light when electricity is passed through them.<\/p>\n<p>And as this new technology went on, the incandescent light bulb and the price of tungsten went \u2018pop\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Has the $40 billion light bulb industry had its day?<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p>The incandescent light bulb changed the world \u2013 the Industrial Revolution partly depended on it.<br \/>\n<strong>Timeline<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>1878: First bulb invented<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It has been around a while. 132 years in fact, since the English physicist Sir Joseph Wilson Swan, invented it in 1878, one year before Thomas Edison \u2013 who got the glory. While Wilson Swan\u2019s carbon fiber filament bulb burned for 13.5 hours, Edison placed his filament in an oxygenless bulb and it burned for 40 hours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1980s: Light-emitting diodes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The next revolution in light came in the 1980s, in the form of light-emitting diodes that lit traffic signs and formed the numbers on digital displays. LEDs are illuminated solely by the movement of electrons in a semiconductor material, such as silicon. Unlike ordinary incandescent bulbs, they don&#8217;t have a filament that will burn out and they don&#8217;t get especially hot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1989: Organic light emitting polymers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Then in 1989 came organic light emitting polymers (OLEPs). This new generation of glowing plastics responded to an electrical current by giving off visible radiation.  Discovered at Cambridge University, and subsequently widely developed by Cambridge Display Technology Ltd, OLEPs removed the need for a silicon-based chip.<\/p>\n<p>Light emitting polymer is an emissive technology. It comprises a fluorescent organic layer, sandwiched between two metal electrodes. Light radiates as the electric current passes through.<\/p>\n<p>OLEPs can be made in the form of thin sheets or films and offer a huge range of applications. Flat screen displays were one of the first products, but polymer can be rolled up and tossed in a briefcase. Clothes made in polymer and powered by a small battery pack could provide their own cinema show.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst the earliest OLEPs were dim and inefficient, giving off a pale green light, the latest plastics are so bright they are difficult to look at directly. Red, green and blue lights were developed. Their neon hues flashed across the night streets and transformed the world\u2019s display and advertising hoarding industry &#8211; worth $85 million in 2005.<\/p>\n<p>But the jewel in the crown was white light.<\/p>\n<p>Initially, OLEPs could emit light only over a very narrow range of wavelengths, so were poor for general lighting use. The ideal lighting source in a house or office is one that gives out a broad spectrum of light. Scientists first tried making white light from a number of differently colored light emitting diodes that spanned the visible spectrum, but this resulted in poor color stability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: White light<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Then, in 2002, researchers found they could stimulate polymers to phosphoresce. This resulted in a white light equivalent to some of the best commercial fluorescent bulbs at the time. Whilst these early lights compared to only 5% of the power efficiency of an incandescent bulb, and 20% of a fluorescent bulb, scientists knew their devices could outperform conventional lighting technologies, given the pace of research.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this white light causing another revolution? Because it\u2019s cheap and it\u2019s flexible. Light emitting polymers can be grown with ease and affordability on virtually any surface. And they cheap to run: OLEPs will save billions of dollars in energy costs.<\/p>\n<p>And then there is the effect \u2013 which is simply stunning. Large-area sources of light can be integrated into interior building materials such as ceiling panels and wallpaper. You can light brightly or you can diffuse it, in any shape, color or texture. Rooms with whole walls of light are being shown in the pages of the trendiest interior magazines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Value of light in future<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If the general illumination industry was worth $40 billion in 2003, when the incandescent bulb still dangled in the middle of our rooms, how much more will the pure white light from organic light emitting polymers be worth in the years to come?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The lights went up last night in London as South Bank, the capital city\u2019s new theatre and arts complex, was unveiled.

This is just the beginning of a whole new trend in business.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p>The word \u2018avatar\u2019 comes from Sanskrit, meaning \u2018Earthly incarnation of a Hindu deity in human or animal form\u2019 &#8211; especially one of the incarnations of Vishnu, such as Rama and Krishna. It is the embodiment of something, or someone who embodies, personifies, or is the manifestation of an idea or concept.<\/p>\n<p>In computing, \u2018avatar\u2019 is used to describe the image of a person in virtual reality. It is a moveable, three-dimensional image that can be used to represent somebody in cyberspace \u2013 for example, an Internet user. If you remember the movie, \u2018The Net\u2019, Sandra Bullock talked to avatars in the chat rooms.<\/p>\n<p>The subject of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has always fascinated. In 1816, the English author Mary Shelley\u2019s novel, \u2018Frankenstein\u2019, was published to resounding public success. The monster created by a mad scientist, which gains human emotion, was later immortalized by Boris Karloff in the 1931 film.<\/p>\n<p>Latterly there was Arthur C Clarke\u2019s short story, \u2018The Sentinel\u2019, which depicts HAL the megalomaniac computer; Stanley Kubrick turned this into his cinema masterpiece, \u20182001\u2019. Clarke followed this with his 2003 bestseller, \u20183001: The Final Odyssey\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>There was Rutger Hauer\u2019s haunting portrayal of an android in \u2018Bladerunner\u2019, the film based on Philip K Dick\u2019s novel, \u2018Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\u2019; \u2018Westworld\u2019 and Steven Spielberg\u2019s film, \u2018AI\u2019 \u2013 not to mention the hugely popular \u2018Terminator\u2019 films.<\/p>\n<p><b>Timeline<\/b><\/p>\n<p><strong>1941: Artificial Machinery<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Traditional Artificial Intelligence grows out of efforts to crack enemy codes in the Second World War. The concept of \u2018Artificial Machinery\u2019 is mooted by Alan Turing, the mathematician and computer scientist who breaks the Enigma code at Bletchley Park, Britain\u2019s Defense Code &amp; Cipher Department.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1960s: Fuzzy logic<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The science of AI takes a big leap forward when computer scientist, Professor Lotfi Zadeh, proposes his theory of \u2018fuzzy logic\u2019. This breaks from the Classical tradition of logic, by attempting to mirror the imprecision in the real world. Fuzzy logic provides a model for human reasoning, in which everything is a matter of degree. It forms the basis of the discipline \u2018soft computing\u2019, which enables programmers to develop code to mirror human speech and facial movement.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1997: Clarke Test<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Arthur C Clarke\u2019s \u2018Clarke Test\u2019 for computer consciousness is if it showed a genuine sense of humor \u2013 to make jokes at its own expense.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Conscious software<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2018Conscious\u2019 software \u2013 machinery that can think &#8211; takes a leap forward, when Stan Franklin, a computer scientist at the University of Memphis, Tennessee, announces his \u2018Intelligent Distributed Agents\u2019 (IDA) program. This computer system is designed to help the US Navy automate the work of some of its personnel. IDA can decide how and where to billet service personnel when they came off a tour of duty \u2013 work that requires judgment, understanding and emotion.<\/p>\n<p>Igor Aleksander argues in the New Scientist that our brains contain a persistent representation of the outside world, which is encoded in the electrochemical impulses. Once computers can mimic five mechanisms \u2013 sense of place, imagination, directed attention, planning and emotion \u2013 they would become \u2018conscious\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>The sense of reality of avatars increases as the interface in the technology between man and machine improves. Nvidia\u2019s new Geoforce graphics card provides a much higher level of reality in the drawing of avatars. Where the computer game character, Lara Croft\u2019s features were less detailed, the facial expressions of Nvidia\u2019s \u2018Dawn Fairy\u2019 are highly realized.<\/p>\n<p>Raymond Kurzweil, one of America\u2019s foremost computer scientists and thinkers on Artificial Intelligence, writes that he believes machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence within a few decades. His female avatar, Ramona \u2013 Kurzweil\u2019s alter ego &#8211; is one of the most highly developed in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Then comes the movie, \u2018Simone\u2019, the story of a Hollywood actress created by a down-at- heel director, who gains immediate celebrity status without anyone realizing she is an avatar. This takes the concept of the avatar to a new level \u2013 what is surprising is how unsurprising the idea of the avatar has become.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Avatars feel real<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Avatars begin to feel real as well as look real.

Hospitals, nursing homes, taxi companies, catering companies, emergency medical alert support and drug companies &#8211; all have benefited from the continuing influx of elderly Europeans and Ameri-cans.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1980s, it was the manufacturing industry that looked to the cheaper pro-duction costs of the Far East. Then, early in the millennium, European businesses began to move call centres to India to benefit from its lower labor costs. It was only a matter of time before Japan began to ship some of its elderly population to The Philippines for care, beginning a trend that has spawned one of South-East Asia&#8217;s most successful industries.<\/p>\n<hr\/>\n<h5>ANALYSIS >> SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p><strong>2000: The young-old balance shifted<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The world population is 6 billion. The proportion of people aged 60+ years in the more developed regions (19%) is slightly higher than the proportion of children below 15 years (18%).<\/p>\n<p>The population of the European Union is 375 million people. However, due to low fertility and increased longevity, this is expected to fall to 300 million in 2050, despite immigration. The birthrate in Italy is the lowest in the EU \u2013 and one of the lowest in the world &#8211; at 1.2 children per women. A birthrate of 2.1 children is needed in Italy to keep the population stable.<\/p>\n<p>By contrast, the population of the USA is increasing. Currently just under 280 million, it is projected to rise to almost 350 million in 2050.<\/p>\n<p>The young-old balance has shifted throughout the world, as the proportion of children declines further. This number rose from 2.8 million in 2000, and is expected to rise to 5.2 million in 2025.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: Population growing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Globally the population has grown by 0.1 billion in the last year. The United Nations&#8217; report, <i>State of the World Population 2002<\/i>, predicts that it will increase from 6.2 billion in 2002, to 9.2 billion by 2050. In the least developed countries, where fertility and population growth is highest, the figure is expected to triple by 2050.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Massive ageing of world population predicted<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The UN demographers cut 400 million people from their best estimate of the world\u2019s population in 2050. It is now expected to be 8.9 billion. The report warns that fertility rates will be well below replacement levels in three-quarter of the world by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>The report also warns that the next five decades will see a massive ageing of the world population. The number of people aged 80+ will rise fivefold by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>In 2003, one in every ten people is 60 years or above. The older population is itself ageing. The oldest old (80+ years) are the fastest growing segment of the older population. These people make up 11% of the 60+ years age group, which will increase to 19% in 2050.<\/p>\n<p>There are striking regional differences. One out of every five European is 60+ years, compared with one in twenty Africans. Japan has the most rapidly ageing population in the world. It also has one of the lowest proportion of foreigners \u2013 barely 1%. 5,000 immigrants are needed for every one million Japanese inhabitants each year, just to maintain the worker-pension ratio.<\/p>\n<p>Over four million elderly Japanese people need nursing care. The Japanese Finance Minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, proposes to send his country&#8217;s elderly to nursing homes in the Philippines, where care is much cheaper in and there is a greater proportion of younger people to look after them.<\/p>\n<p>In Europe there is a collapse in pensions. 12 million workers do not have an occupational pension.

There were angry scenes at the birthday party of Justine de Sera, the first human clone.

It would allow some infertile couples to have children genetically related to themselves and in theory let people \u2018copy\u2019 dead relatives. In this process, an individual organism is produced from another organism and therefore they are genetically identical. It involves taking an egg from a donor and replacing its nucleus with a cell containing the DNA of the creature to be cloned. The resulting embryo is then placed in a surrogate mother.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Therapeutic cloning\u2019 is the most controversial but exciting new area made possible by cloning technology.  In this form of cloning, human embryos would be produced by taking genetic material from a patient, and fusing that with an unfertilized egg. This is cultured for 6-7 day; certain cells are extracted and the embryos destroyed.  The cloned embryo used in is not placed in a surrogate mother, but is harvested for useful stem cells that can be used to grow replacement body parts \u2013 eg to produce nerve cells with which to treat Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1983: World&#8217;s first test-tube baby<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The world\u2019s first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, is born amidst much furore about \u2018Man playing God\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1993: PDG Technique><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mark Hughes, a molecular biologist working at the University of Georgetown, Washington, develops the \u2018preimplantation genetic diagnosis\u2019 technique (PGD).

Whilst the ban on \u2018designer babies\u2019 is reversed in the UK, surveys show nine out of ten people oppose baby cloning, with its images of Petri dishes, glowing test tubes and Dr Frankenstein.<\/p>\n<p>Within a month of the case, the researchers who created Dolly the sheep are granted the first UK licence to create human embryos for stem cell research.<\/p>\n<p>In vitro fertilization (IVF), in which sperm and eggs are mixed in a dish and the resulting embryo transplanted to a mother, has a 15% success rate at this time \u2013 yet there is little fuss on lost embryos. More than one million babies have now been born using the technique.<\/p>\n<p>In August, scientists announce the arrival of Promotea, the first-ever cloned horse. She is the sole survivor of a process that began with more than 800 eggs implanted with foreign nuclei. Of these, 22 survived a week as embryos. Seventeen were implanted in horses and four pregnancies resulted. All but one failed.<\/p>\n<p>In the USA, federal funds may not be used towards research on therapeutic cloning at this time.

In 2003, each passenger onboard a Princess cruise ship generates at least 1.5kg of waste per day &#8211; a figure that was set to rapidly increase.  From the 8 tons of solid waste generated by a modern cruise liner per week, nearly 25% can now be reclaimed as bioplastic polymer.<\/p>\n<p>The technology has particular application in the marine industry, where all waste must be disposed of in accordance with international law.

They estimate that PHB makes up approximately 70% of the bacterial mass used in the production process.<\/p>\n<p>The British Royal Navy revolutionises onboard waste management techniques by installing an Integrated Water Management System (IWMS) into the latest Type 45 destroyer. The installation, designed by QinetiQ, uses a membrane bioreactor to treat grey water and sewage, as well as maceration and incineration for clinical and galley waste. The design brief for the system requires it to manage 30m3 of liquid and 2m3 of solid waste per day. The IWMS can cope with ten types of shipboard waste, notably food waste, general garbage, grey water and black water. The integrated approach allows greater operational costs and reduced offloading costs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: Princess Cruises part of Carnival Corporation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Princess Cruises, a premiere cruise line, becomes part of the Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL), one of the world\u2019s largest vacation companies.

You can now make almost anything you want, custom-built, right in your kitchen, using the new Sony Nano Assembler.<\/p>\n<p>This gizmo is a microwave look-alike &#8211; at least superficially. By using the atoms available in your garbage, the Sony P1 is able to assemble anything &#8211; from a fresh lettuce to a spare part for your car.<\/p>\n<p>The development is set to have a huge impact on consumer behavior. Wal-Mart has announced it will target to become an information business, replacing its food counters with a space age web site from which you can download the blueprints for all its food products &#8211; at less than 10% of the cost of the physical equivalent.<\/p>\n<p>Like many new products, the performance of the Sony P1 disappoints. It is slow &#8211; it takes more than five minutes to assemble a crisp lettuce. Right now the product still costs more than three personal computers, but Sony expects the costs of these devices to drop by more than 30-40% per annum. It will also get faster; in three years, Sony expects the time to create a full meal to be down to minutes.<\/p>\n<p>The new version of the P1 already being prototyped on the International Space Station, has new software features that will be available on the earth-bound version within 12 months.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be able to choose from six types of lettuce, complete with however many dewdrops you fancy!<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h5>ANALYSIS &gt;&gt; SYNTHESIS: How this scenario came to be<\/h5>\n<p>Nanoscience \u2013 manipulating and building devices atom-by-atom and molecule-by-molecule \u2013 is startling in its potential.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a box of Lego bricks, then think of these as \u2018atoms\u2019 that you could put together to make a molecule. Two hydrogen atoms and one atom of oxygen make water \u2013 the molecule H20. Early nanoassemblers worked on the molecular level: they picked up molecules and built more complex materials out of that.<\/p>\n<p>But the dream was to perfect the making of commercial nanoassemblers that could perform this process at an atomic level. Nano scientists envisioned the picking up of atoms to create molecules that may not even exist in Nature. These might be new materials or ones copied from an atomic-level blueprint which could be downloaded to an assembler via the Internet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Timeline<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>1999: First nanotechnology laboratory&gt;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The $34 billion food giant, Kraft Foods, start the first nanotechnology research laboratory. Aware that conventional food science won\u2019t keep the company competitive, and keen to maintain its leadership position, Kraft is amongst the first of the big food companies to begin nano research.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2000: NanoteK created<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kraft forms a consortium, NanoteK, which comprises leading universities and national research laboratories. Physicists, engineers and molecular scientists, not food scientists, carry out the development and research that might yield cutting-edge food technology. Several groups study nanoparticles that encapsulate certain flavors, colors or nutrients, and which could be zapped by a microwave or some other method, to deliver their payload. NanoteK\u2019s focus is on the customization of food products.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2002: UK invests in nanoscience&gt;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nanoscience is getting serious attention. Governments around the world spend $2 billion on nanotech research this year. Building on the UK\u2019s excellent scientific track record, the British Science &amp; Innovations Minister announces a \u00a390 million cash injection to aid nanotechnology research and facilities, following the government report, \u2018New Dimensions for Manufacturing \u2013 a UK Strategy for Nanotechnology\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2003: NASA prototype<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>NASA prototypes a molecular nanoassembler in the Space Shuttle program for the production of selected spare parts in space. Production is limited to the use of two metals and two plastics.<\/p>\n<p>In food science, industry and academia can see the potential to build very well defined food structures from organic and non-organic materials through nanoassembly. Some have a vision of an abundant food supply to poorer countries: the generation of food by non-biological means using advanced nanotechnology, would ensure nutrition in countries with limited resources. For others it is the customization and personalization of products \u2013 foods that recognize a person\u2019s profile, nutritional needs and allergies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2005: Nanoassembler commecialised&gt;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>NASA and a consortium of private enterprises commercialise a molecular nanoassembler. Research is underway to develop atomic level assemblers. Multi-disciplinary networks of companies across the scientific spectrum band together to build a common architecture that can be used across all industries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2006: Major failures<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>News reports of some major failures create negative publicity but the success of commercial molecular assemblers in the automotive and yachting world spur further investments. The public remains unconvinced.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2007: Hollywood blockbuster&gt;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A major Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster features the design ideas of Sony, IBM and Dyson, including their versions of the application of nanoassemblers. The hype starts at the premiere and does not wane. The high cost of early machines still limits their usage but their presence in the homes of glitterati assures continued demand. The idea of food manufactured to your specific designs captures the imagination of the media and public alike \u2013 even though the practical reality is still some years off.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2008: Impact on retail companies<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The food retail companies have begun to understand the implications nanoscience will have on consumer behavior. The likes of Marks &amp; Spencer and Wal-Mart target to become information businesses, by replacing some of their food counters with space age web sites.<\/p>\n<p>They see it working like this: the Sony P1 Nanoassembler connects direct to your Internet or Hypernet connection. If it\u2019s a Cos lettuce you fancy, you click on the menu and select a supplier \u2013 Marks &amp; Spencer, for example. The purchase is approved via your mobile phone PIN number at 10% of the price of the physical lettuce. Within seconds M&amp;S downloads the molecular blueprint for the Cos lettuce. Assembly begins right in front of you, atom by atom.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not only the food companies that benefit. Think of the potential for spare automobile parts! If you need a new gasket for your vintage BMWz4, you can arrange the order within minutes on the BMW website, place the payment, download the molecular blueprint and watch the gasket assembly start. Then all you need is the open road!<\/p>\n<p><strong>2010: Sony P1 launched<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sony launches their first P1 \u2013 their first commercial product that they believe will establish the new standard for household appliances.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1026\" src=\"https:\/\/futureworld.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ScenarioMatrix2.gif\"><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pushing the trolley around the supermarket looks soon to become a thing of the past.
